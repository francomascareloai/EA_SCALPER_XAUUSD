# BMAD Brainstorming Workflow

This workflow guides you through a brainstorming session for your project, leveraging the BMAD method.

## Step 1: Context Loading
1.  **Read Project Context**: Read `BMAD-METHOD/src/modules/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/brainstorm-project/project-context.md` (if it exists) or ask the user for context.
2.  **Identify Goal**: Ask the user what specific area they want to brainstorm (e.g., new feature, architecture, refactoring).

## Step 2: Brainstorming Session
1.  **Initiate Brainstorming**: Use the "Sequential Thinking" or "Brainstorming" technique.
    *   Generate ideas based on the project context.
    *   Explore different angles (technical, user-centric, risk-based).
2.  **Iterate**: Present ideas to the user and ask for feedback. Refine based on their input.

## Step 3: Capture Results
1.  **Summarize**: Create a summary of the brainstorming session.
2.  **Save**: Save the results to a new file in `docs/brainstorming/session-[date].md` (create directory if needed).
3.  **Update Status**: Inform the user that the session is complete and results are saved.

## Step 4: Next Steps
1.  **Suggest Next Workflow**: Recommend running `bmad-tech-spec` to turn these ideas into a technical specification.
