# BMAD Brainstorming Session

Topic: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Step 1: Context Loading

Loading project context from:
- `BMAD-METHOD/` documentation
- Existing codebase patterns
- Previous decisions

**What specific area do you want to brainstorm?**
- New feature
- Architecture improvement
- Strategy refinement
- Risk management
- Other

## Step 2: Brainstorming Techniques

Using **Sequential Thinking** to:
1. Generate ideas based on project context
2. Explore different angles:
   - **Technical**: Implementation possibilities
   - **User-centric**: Trading experience
   - **Risk-based**: What could go wrong?
3. Iterate based on your feedback

## Step 3: Idea Generation

For each idea, I'll provide:
- **Concept**: What is it?
- **Benefit**: Why do it?
- **Effort**: How hard?
- **Risk**: What could fail?

## Step 4: Capture Results

After brainstorming, I'll:
1. Summarize all ideas
2. Save to `DOCS/brainstorming/session-[date].md`
3. Rank by priority/feasibility

## Step 5: Next Steps

Recommend follow-up workflows:
- `/tech-spec` - Turn ideas into technical specification
- `/new-feature` - Implement a specific idea
- `/research` - Deep dive on a concept
