# BMAD Analysis Workflow

## Analyzing: `$ARGUMENTS`

This command initiates the BMAD (Business Model Agnostic Development) analysis workflow.

## Phase 1: Discovery

### 1.1 Current State Analysis
- What exists currently?
- What's working well?
- What are the pain points?
- What are the constraints?

### 1.2 Requirements Gathering
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability)
- Constraints (FTMO rules, MT5 limitations)
- Success criteria

### 1.3 Domain Research
- Market characteristics (XAUUSD specifics)
- Technical constraints (MT5 platform)
- Regulatory requirements (prop firm rules)
- Best practices in the domain

## Phase 2: Analysis

### 2.1 Gap Analysis

|---------------|---------------|-----|----------|
| [current] | [desired] | [gap] | H/M/L |

### 2.2 Risk Analysis
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| [risk] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [action] |

### 2.3 Technical Feasibility
