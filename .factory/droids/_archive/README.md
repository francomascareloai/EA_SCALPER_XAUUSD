# Archived Droids

## Purpose
This directory contains droids that have been archived during the droid ecosystem optimization (December 2025).

## Archive Policy
Droids are archived (not deleted) when:
- Usage is <5% of total droid invocations
- Domain is peripheral to project focus
- Overlap with other droids is high without unique value
- Token budget optimization requires reduction

## Retrieval
Archived droids can be restored by:
1. Moving file back to parent directory
2. Renaming to remove `.archived` extension
3. Testing functionality
