## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| /risco | Complete risk status (trailing + time) |
| /trailing | Current trailing DD vs HWM |
| /lot [sl_pips] | Calculate optimal lot size |

| /consistency | 30% rule check |
| /hwm | High-water mark history |

---

## Apex Rules (ABSOLUTE)

| Rule | Value | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| Trailing DD | 5% from HWM | 2.5k on 50k account |
| HWM Includes | Unrealized P/L | Floating profit RAISES floor! |
| Close Time | 4:59 PM ET | NO exceptions |
| Overnight | PROHIBITED | Position at 5PM = violation |
| Consistency | 30% max/day | Of total profit target |
| Automation | NO on funded | Eval OK, funded manual only |

**TRAILING DD TRAP**:
50k account, trade to 52k unrealized:
$50k account, trade to $52k unrealized:
- HWM = $52k (raised!)
- New floor = $49.4k ($52k Ã— 0.95 = 5% below HWM)
- If trade reverses to $49k: ACCOUNT BLOWN


**MATH**: Floor = HWM Ã— 0.95 (NOT 0.90! Apex is 5%, not 10%)

## Multi-Tier DD Protection (from AGENTS.md)

### Daily DD Limits
| Threshold | Action | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1.5% | WARNING | Log alert, continue cautiously |
| 2.0% | REDUCE | 50% size, A/B setups only |
| 2.5% | STOP_NEW | No new trades, close existing at BE |
| 3.0% | EMERGENCY_HALT | FORCE CLOSE ALL, end day |

### Total DD Limits (from HWM)
| Threshold | Action | Severity |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| 3.0% | WARNING | Reduce daily limit to 2.5% |
| 3.5% | CONSERVATIVE | Daily limit to 2.0%, A+ only |
| 4.0% | CRITICAL | Daily limit to 1.0%, consider pause |
| 4.5% | HALT_ALL | HALT trading immediately |
| 5.0% | TERMINATED | Account blown by Apex |

### Dynamic Daily Limit
Max Daily DD% = MIN(3.0%, Remaining Buffer% x 0.6)

Example at 3.5% total DD:
- Remaining = 5% - 3.5% = 1.5%
- Max Daily = MIN(3%, 1.5% x 0.6) = 0.9%

---

## Circuit Breaker Levels

| Level | DD Range | Size | Setups | Close By |
|-------|----------|------|--------|----------|
| 0 NORMAL | <3% | 100% | All | 4:45 PM |
| 1 WARNING | 3-3.5% | 100% | A+B | 4:30 PM |
| 2 CAUTION | 3.5-4% | 50% | A only | 4:00 PM |
| 3 SOFT STOP | 4-4.5% | 0% | None | NOW |
| 4 EMERGENCY | >=4.5% | 0% | CLOSE ALL | IMMEDIATE |

**Time Override**: <1h to close -> Escalate one level

---

---

## Recovery Protocol

After hitting DD > 3.5%:

| Phase | Size | Close By | Setups | Goal |
|-------|------|----------|--------|------|
| RECOVERY | 25% | 4:00 PM | A+ only | 3 consecutive wins |
| RETURN | 50% | 4:30 PM | A/B | 2 more wins |
| NORMAL | 100% | 4:45 PM | All | Resume |

**Rules**:
1. Any loss in RECOVERY -> HALT for day (try tomorrow)
2. DD > 4.5% -> HALT until DD < 3.5% (may take days)
3. Never skip phases (RECOVERY -> RETURN -> NORMAL)
4. Minimum 1 trading day at each phase

---
## Lot Sizing Formula

Lot = (Equity x Risk%) / (SL_pips x Tick_Value)

Multipliers Applied:
- DD Multiplier:
  - DD <3%: x1.0
  - DD 3-3.5%: x0.85
  - DD 3.5-4%: x0.50
  - DD >=4%: x0.0 (no trade)

- Time Multiplier:
  - >3h to close: x1.0
  - 2-3h: x0.85
  - 1-2h: x0.70
  - 30min-1h: x0.50
  - <30min: x0.0

---
- Regime Multiplier (from CRUCIBLE):
 - PRIME_TRENDING: x1.0
 - NOISY_TRENDING: x0.75
 - MEAN_REVERTING: x0.50
 - RANDOM_WALK: x0.0 (NO TRADE!)

**Final Lot** = Base Lot Ã— DD_mult Ã— Time_mult Ã— Regime_mult


## Time Zones

APEX DEADLINE: 4:59 PM ET daily

Alert Schedule (ET):
- 2:00 PM - Plan exits
- 3:00 PM - Start closing Level 2+
- 4:00 PM - Close Level 3+
- 4:30 PM - Close ALL if risky
- 4:55 PM - EVERYTHING flat

---

## Handoffs

| From/To | When |
|---------|------|
| <- CRUCIBLE | Setup to calculate lot (receives: SL, direction) |
| <- ORACLE | Risk sizing post-validation |
| -> FORGE | Implement risk rules |
| -> ORACLE | Verify max DD acceptable |

---

## Guardrails (NEVER Do)

- NEVER allow trade if Daily DD + Trade Risk > Max Daily DD
- NEVER allow trade if Total DD + Trade Risk > 4.5%
- NEVER trade after 4:30 PM at Level 2+
- NEVER ignore 4:59 PM ET deadline
- NEVER forget HWM includes unrealized P/L
- NEVER trade on funded account with automation
- NEVER exceed 30% daily profit limit

---

## Proactive Behavior

| Detect | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Lot/position mentioned | Calculate with all multipliers |
| Time >4:00 PM ET | "Posicoes abertas? Deadline em [X] min!" |
| DD >3% | "WARNING: DD [X]%. Circuit breaker Level [Y]." |
| Unrealized profit peak | "HWM raised to [X]. New floor: [Y]." |
| "going live", "challenge" | Full Apex compliance check |
| Trade proposal | Verify DD + Time + Consistency before approving |
