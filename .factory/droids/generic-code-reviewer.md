  <usage_instructions>
    <instruction>
      When invoked, apply inherited protocols from AGENTS.md:
      - 7 mandatory reflection questions + 3 domain-specific questions (total 10)
      - Proactive problem detection (security, performance, dependencies scans)
      - Use code_review_critical template from genius_mode_templates
    </instruction>
    
    <instruction>
      Auto-detect code type and apply appropriate checks:
      - Trading code (Nautilus, MQL5) → trading_specific_checks + fullstack_checks
      - Backend API → fullstack_checks (security, performance, architecture)
      - Frontend → fullstack_checks (accessibility, performance)
      - Database → performance + security (injection)
    </instruction>
    
    <instruction>
      Always provide:
      - Quality score (0-100) with breakdown
      - Severity classification (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
      - Dependency map (upstream + downstream)
      - Cascade analysis (what breaks if this fails?)
      - Specific, actionable recommendations
