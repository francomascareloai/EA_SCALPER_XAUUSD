# ML Trading Research Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides a structured approach to researching Machine Learning applications in algorithmic trading, with focus on:
- Deep Learning for financial time series
- ONNX integration with MQL5/MetaTrader 5
- Feature engineering for trading models
- Statistical regime detection
- Production deployment patterns

## Research Protocol

### Phase 1: Query Decomposition

Before searching, decompose the ML trading query into sub-questions:

1. **Theoretical Foundation**: What does academic research say?
2. **Implementation Examples**: What code/repos exist?
3. **Performance Evidence**: What backtests/live results exist?
4. **Production Considerations**: What are deployment challenges?

### Phase 2: Multi-Source Search Strategy

Execute searches across these source categories:

#### Academic Sources
```
Search patterns:
- "arXiv q-fin [topic]" - Quantitative finance papers
- "SSRN [topic] trading" - Financial economics papers
- "machine learning financial time series" - General ML finance
- "[model] gold price prediction" - Specific asset
```

Use: `perplexity-search` or `brave-search` with academic focus

#### Code Repositories
```
Search patterns:
- "GitHub [model] trading Python"
- "GitHub ONNX MQL5"
- "GitHub LSTM forex"
- "QuantConnect [strategy]"
```

Use: `github___search_repositories` or `github___search_code`

#### Technical Documentation
```
Search patterns:
- Context7 for library docs (PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX)
- MQL5.com documentation for ONNX functions
- Specific library documentation
```

Use: `context7___get-library-docs`

#### Industry/Practitioner Sources
```
Search patterns:
- "MQL5 community ONNX"
- "QuantConnect forum [topic]"
- "[broker] API machine learning"
```

Use: `brave-search` or `WebSearch`

### Phase 3: Evaluation Framework

For each finding, evaluate:

| Criterion | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Validity** | Is the methodology sound? Sample size? OOS testing? |
| **Reproducibility** | Can we implement this? Code available? |
| **Applicability** | Does it work for XAUUSD? Scalping timeframes? |
| **Production-Ready** | Latency acceptable? ONNX exportable? |

### Phase 4: Synthesis

Compile findings into actionable format:

```markdown
## ML Research Report: [TOPIC]

### Key Finding
[Main conclusion with confidence level]

### Implementation Recommendation
[Specific steps to implement]

### Code References
[Links to repos, papers, docs]

### Risks/Limitations
[What could go wrong]

### Next Steps
[Concrete actions]
```
