## What Is Trend Vision?

**Trend Vision** is a custom MT4 indicator that combines **MACD momentum** with **Bollinger Bands volatility** to give clear, reliable trading signals.

* **MACD** shows momentum shifts, divergence, and trend strength.
* **Bollinger Bands** measure volatility, expansion, and squeezes.

By fusing these two, Trend Vision filters out false moves and highlights **only the high-probability moments** when both momentum and volatility agree.

---

## How It Works (Simple)

1. **MACD checks momentum** (fast vs slow MA).
2. **Bollinger Band math measures volatility** (moving average + standard deviation).
3. When both conditions align, Trend Vision:

   * Plots **color changes** and **dots/lines**.
   * Sends an **alert** (if enabled).
   * Shows the shift visually so you can act quickly.

---

## Key Features

* **MACD + Bollinger Fusion** → double confirmation for signals.
* **Visual Signals** → color change + arrows/dots on chart.
* **Multi-Timeframe Use** → works from 1M scalping to weekly swings.
* **Alert System** → on-screen, push, email, sound alerts.
* **Filter Options** → choose stricter or more frequent signals.
* **Performance Control** → limit bars calculated for speed.

### Calculation

* **FastLen (default = 12)** – Fast MA period for MACD.
* **SlowLen (default = 26)** – Slow MA period for MACD.
* **Length (default = 10)** – Period used for both MA and standard deviation in Bollinger math.
* **barsCount (default = 400)** – Maximum number of chart bars to process (higher = more history).
* **StDv (default = 2.5)** – Standard deviation multiplier (controls band width).

### Alerts

* **EnableNativeAlerts (false)** – Show MT4 pop-up alerts when a color change occurs.
* **EnableSoundAlerts (false)** – Play a sound on color change.

  + **SoundFileName ("alert.wav")** – Sound file to play.
* **EnableEmailAlerts (false)** – Send email alerts (requires MT4 email setup).
* **EnablePushAlerts (false)** – Send push alerts to MT4 mobile (requires MT4 notifications setup).
* **StricterAlerts (false)** – Alerts only on first change **above zero (bullish)** or **below zero (bearish)** for cleaner signals.
