The **High and Low Line Indicator** is a straightforward yet powerful tool designed to plot the highest and lowest price levels of a selected symbol directly on the chart. This indicator allows traders to visually identify key support and resistance levels, which can be crucial in making informed trading decisions.

#### **Use Cases:**

* **Identifying Support and Resistance:** The high and low lines often act as natural support and resistance levels, providing clear points for entry, exit, or stop-loss placement.
* **Breakout Trading:** Monitor when the price breaks above the high line or falls below the low line, which can signal potential breakout opportunities.

The CDebugLogger class is a flexible and comprehensive logging utility designed for use in MQL4/5 environments. It allows developers to log messages at various levels of importance (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG) with options to include timestamps, function signatures, file names, and line numbers in the log entries. The class supports logging to both the console and files, with the ability to save logs in a common folder and in CSV format. Additionally, it offers functionality to silence logs based on specific keywords, ensuring that sensitive information is not logged. This class is ideal for developers looking to implement robust logging mechanisms in their MQL4/5 applications, with customizable features that cater to a wide range of debugging and monitoring needs.
