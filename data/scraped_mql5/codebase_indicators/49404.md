The SMI Ergodic Oscillator indicator displays the difference between the [True Strength Index](/en/code/22783) and its exponentially smoothed signal line.

It has three adjustable parameters:

* **Long Length** - primary smoothing period for TSI calculation
* **Short Length** - secondary smoothing period for TSI calculation.
* **Signal Line Length** - period of signal line smoothing for SMI calculation.

The ergodic oscillator gives the following signals related to the zero level crossing:

* Finding the oscillator line for a long time in the zone below zero and then crossing it from bottom to top indicates the possibility of opening a long position;
* Similarly, when the oscillator is above zero level for a long time and then crosses it from top to bottom, it indicates a favourable moment to open a short position.

Looks like a great indicator and gives good quality signals. Certainly a powerful [momentum](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/momentum "MetaTrader 5 Help: Momentum Indicator") indicator to catch sudden price divergences.
