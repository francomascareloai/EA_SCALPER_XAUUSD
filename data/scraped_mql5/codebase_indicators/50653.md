This works great, only problem is it leaves the st and tp values on the chart as objects after the trade has closed, is it possible to update the code so it auto removes the objects after the trade has closed?

Of course, it is possible. Code it or pay someone.

The easiest way is to write some code to detect whether any open positions exist and if not, auto-delete each object.

Can you create an SL TP Setter for MT5? I have one for mt4 but no one did anything to add one for mt5
