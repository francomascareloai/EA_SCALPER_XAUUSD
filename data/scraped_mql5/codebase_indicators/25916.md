The script exports summary of closed trades selected between two dates grouped by each trading day. The resulting file is CSV that can be
opened/imported with any spreadsheet software.

To export summary for the entire trading history, keep **Start date** and **End date** at their
default values.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/83/Capture__9.PNG)

The CSV file is located at: Terminal > File > Open data folder > MQL4\Files\<Filename>

The CSV file will be auto-opened with the associated Windows program (e.g., Microsoft Excel or Ron's CSV Editor).

Following data columns are exported for each trading day:

* **Date of the trading day**
* **Total trades**
* **Volumes**
* **Profits**
* **Swaps**
* **Commissions**
* **Net profits**

**![](https://c.mql5.com/18/83/Capture3__1.PNG)**

The CSV file can be opened with Microsoft Excel or better with  
Ron's CSV Editor.

Hi again,

where I can find ArrayObj.mqh?

In the Include folder.

The compiler will find it.
