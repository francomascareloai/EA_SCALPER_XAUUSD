Hello Sir.  This is indeed what I was looking for, but alas it didn't appear correctly.  I know it was just posted recently, I just thought I'd notify you.  What occurred on my end was- after the download onto MT4, the indicator window appeared correctly, but the histogram did not appear.  Any solutions?  Thank you-
