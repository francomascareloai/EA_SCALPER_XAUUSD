I would like to bring to your attention an Expert Advisor.

When an order is open, the Expert Advisor places additional orders according to the specified grid, with or without lot increase (depends on the settings). You can also configure grid placement by two indicators: RSI and CCI, but at the grid step. That is grid+signal.

We close positions when a profit is reached, or profit + MA reversal.

It is possible to close Sell or Buy separately, as well as the whole series together.

He can also trade by signals himself.

If anyone finds errors in the code or helps to optimise it - I will be glad.
