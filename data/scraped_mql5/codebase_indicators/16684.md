The attached script allows you to close more orders at once.

You can choose the following filters:

* Only instrument in the chart where the script is run or all instruments.
* Only orders in profit.
* Only orders in loss.
* Only order matching a magic number.
* Only order marching a comment.

The script will scan all the open orders and close the ones matching the criteria.

**Geymer Morales:**  

Hello,

How to use the parameter "Close only Orders Maching the magic number"....

That is to filter to close orders only if they have a [specific Magic Number](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/125 "Articles: The Optimal Method for Calculation of Total Position Volume by Specified Magic Number")
