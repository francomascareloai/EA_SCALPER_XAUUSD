**Murrey Math Line X MetaTrader indicator** — a pivot line indicator that will definitely help every trader who knows how to trade with support, resistance, and pivot lines. It displays 8 primary lines (with 5 more additional ones) on the main chart, helping you to find the best points to sell, buy, and exit your positions. The indicator can issue alerts when a candle closes after breaking any of the pivot lines. You can download this indicator for MT4 and MT5 platform.

## Input parameters

* **Period** (default = 64) — a period in bars or in other upper timeframe periods (set via the **UpperTimeFrame** input), on which the lines will be calculated. The lower the number the more up-to-date but less accurate calculations.
* **UpperTimeframe** (default = PERIOD\_D1) — a basic period; if different from the current timeframe, the indicator will use *Period* × *UpperTimeframe* periods to calculate its lines. Otherwise, the indicator will use *Period* of the current chart bars to calculate its lines.
* **StepBack** (default = 0) — a shift back for calculating the lines (in the current bars or in the number of **UpperTimeframe** periods).
* **LabelSide** (default = Left) — the side of the screen to display the line labels. If you select *Right*, make sure, the chart is shifted to the left; otherwise, you won't be able to see the labels.
* **[N]/8 Color** — colors for the indicator lines.
* **[N]/8 Width** — the indicator lines' width.
* **MarkColor** (default = clrBlue) — the color for the last calculated bar's arrow.
* **MarkNumber** (default = 217) — the arrow code for the last calculated bar's arrow.
* **FontFace** (default = "Verdana") — the font face to use for display.
* **FontSize** (default = 10) — the font size to use for display.
* **ObjectPrefix** (default = "MML-") — prefix for chart objects for compatibility with other indicators.
* **TriggerCandle** (default = Previous) — the candle to issue alerts on: *Previous* — the most recently closed candle or *Current* — the yet unfinished candle.
* **NativeAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, a native MetaTrader popup alert will be used when a signal appears. Not present in cTrader.
* **EmailAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent when a signal appears. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **NotificationAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent when a signal appears. Notifications should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications*.

It is easy to use Murrey Math Line X. 0/8P and 8/8P lines are the ultimate resistance and support lines — they are very hard to break. 1/8P and 7/8P lines are weak support and resistance lines, but if the price stops near them, it will likely reverse and change direction. 2/8P and 6/8P lines are strong reverse points. 3/8P and 5/8P are the bottom and the top of the average trading range respectively; it is very likely that the price will either pierce this range fast or will remain inside it for a long time. 4/8P is a major support and resistance line; you can sell or buy when the price crosses it for a high-probability trade. The blue arrow marks the final calculated bar.

A bit buggy, but over all good indicator. Useful in telling what has happened with price over time.

[Moving Average Candlesticks MT5](/en/code/55398)

The indicator is available for MT4 and MT5.

![Market Profile MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Market Profile MT5](/en/code/55396)

Market Profile MetaTrader indicator — is a classic Market Profile implementation that can show the price density over time, outlining the most important price levels, value area, and control value of a given trading session. This indicator can be attached to timeframes between M1 and D1 and will show the Market Profile for daily, weekly, monthly, or even intraday sessions. Lower timeframes offer higher precision. Higher timeframes are recommended for better visibility. It is also possible to use a free-draw rectangle session to create a custom market profile on any timeframe. Six different color schemes are available to draw the profile's blocks. Drawing profiles as a plain color histogram is also possible. Alternatively, you may choose to color the profile based on bullish/bearish bars. This indicator is based on bare price action and does not use any standard indicators. It is available for MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5

The indicator can calculate gain/loss in two modes: plain candlestick Close and Open difference, and as difference between current Close and previous Close. You can set minimum change limits (for pips and percentage), change modes, and you can also control font color of the output numbers. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

![Keltner Channel MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Keltner Channel MT5](/en/code/55457)

Keltner Channel (MetaTrader indicator) — is a classical technical analysis indicator developed by Chester W. Keltner in 1960. The indicator is somewhat similar to the Bollinger Bands and Envelopes. It uses three plot lines: the middle line is the 10-day simple moving average applied to the typical price ((high + low + close) / 3), the upper and the lower bands are produced by adding and subtracting the moving average of the daily price range (High and Low difference) from the middle line. This way, a volatility-based channel is built. In this version of the indicator you can modify all the parameters of the MA. The indicator is available both for MT4 and MT5 versions of the platform.
