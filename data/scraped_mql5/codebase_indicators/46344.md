Some indicators experience a bug where the plot drops horizontally or the buffer doesn't update on the chart. The problem can be solved by refreshing the chart.

This will refresh the chart in the background by a user defined refresh period. The default is 1 which means it will be refreshing the chart every minute.

**James Erasmus [#](/en/forum/453903#comment_54240815):**  
 Thanks but didnt solve the problem. Indicator: Dark Point by Solito repaints and has random arrows building above or near bar, then when change time frame and return the arrows go away, or what was a normal [buy signal](/en/articles/522 "Article: MetaTrader 5 Added Trading Signals - Better Than PAMM Accounts! ") is now a strong buy signal. I hoped your indicator would refresh chart so i would not have to change from 3min to 5 min and back for example.

This won't fix such a case with repainting or invalid bar copying. That would be impossible to fix by refreshing the chart, so it is an issue with the design of the indicator you used

It will automatically plot a colored horizontal line on the previous open/highs/lows/close of the selected period, and it will make the lines consistent on this price when switching timeframes.
