This is an edit of the **[Mod\_ATR\_Trailing\_Stop](/en/code/20423)** by [Scriptor](/en/users/scriptor) found here [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/20423](/en/code/20423).

It has 1 Buffer instead of 2 (1 Line instead of 2 Lines) . I was a fan of the original **MT4-LevelStop-Reverse.v2** that was coded originally by Bruce Hellstrom (brucehvn), which used 1 Buffer. This one is the closet I have got to that indicator on MT5.

I was the user that submitted this indicator, but wanted to change my [profile](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/development/profiling "MetaEditor User Guide: Code profiling") name and url.

So any questions on it ask me or Scriptor.
