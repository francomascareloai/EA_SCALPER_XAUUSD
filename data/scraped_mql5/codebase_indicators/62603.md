### 

### Purpose

This is not just a regular ZigZag.  
 It has been designed as a**precise visual reference tool** to  help**balance** or **analyze** other  indicators, whether on the main chart or in sub-windows.

It works**only with confirmed ZigZag values**, ensuring that the displayed points are fully reliable.  
 Each detected move is enriched with key information:

* The**periods** defined  by the ZigZag
* The**exact price** of  the top or bottom
* The**direction** and **movement**
* The**number of pips** covered

All this is displayed in a clear way and can be**fully disabled** via  simple checkboxes in the settings.

---

### Main Features

1. **Custom ZigZag**

   * Adjustable colour, thickness, and style
   * Option to turn ZigZag display on/off
2. **Visual Markers**

   * Colored vertical lines for each top and bottom
   * Distinct colours for highs and lows
   * Perfect alignment with the corresponding bars
3. **Dynamic Labels**

   * Price display + direction symbol (triangle ▲ or ▼)
   * Number of pips between two ZigZag points
   * Adjustable font size and color
   * Smart positioning to avoid overlapping with price candles
4. **Full Control**

   * Boolean parameters to toggle ZigZag and labels independently
   * Option to limit the number of analyzed bars for better performance
   * Automatic removal of all indicator objects upon uninstall
