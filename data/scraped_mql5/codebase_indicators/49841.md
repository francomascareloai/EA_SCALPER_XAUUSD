Hi Dude...Thanks lot for your EA...its wonder in 5min TF - Nas100 and I initiated your EA with live account. Getting reasonable profit and very safe. But i have an issue about lot. in EA, there is no option for initial lot size. I wants to trade with 0.02 Lot but EA takes 0.03 lot automatically. how to fix this initial lot? also, in option "Volume" is there and can you explain the same.

Hello, tried this EA on a 10k account, at the first days, started to get some profits, but checking progress today I saw the account reduced at the half.. Started to open trades and close them almost immediately. I had to remove it completely, even disabling it it was opening a closing trades getting losses. Is this behavior of the code expected?

**flashpaul [#](/en/forum/467211/page2#comment_53620583):**  
 Good EA! I am running it on Gold and in few days gained 20% , but there is a problem: Lot is 0.01, but it opens with 0.04. I checked on Mql4 , but I don't find any error about lot. May you help me? Thank you in advance.

lot size is calculated based on your account balance . If you set lot 0.01 from balance 10.000 usd then if your account balance is 40.000 usd , EA will open 0.04 lot .

So you can downsize the lot by input 0.01 lot from balance 40.000 then it opens order of 0.01
