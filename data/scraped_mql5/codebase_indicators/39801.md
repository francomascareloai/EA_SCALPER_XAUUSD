This indicator calculates and plots the exponential moving average of the true range, as well as an offset of the exponential moving average of its deviation.

The code uses conditional compilation and will compile on both MQL4 and MQL5.

Thank you Fernando for this great indicator.

I use this method to recognize market volatility and range conditions. When the red line is below the blue line, it indicates low volatility and the potential for a range-bound market. Conversely, when the red line is above the blue line, it suggests high volatility.

Additionally, [checking](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/python_metatrader5/mt5ordercalcmargin_py "MQL5 Documentation: order_calc_margin function") this on a higher time frame can provide an extra layer of confirmation.

This Script is the example of using function LineNotify that use to send message to LINE APP via Line Notify service
As the function LineNotify use webrequest to send HTTP request so it can be used in EA or Script program only , can't use in Indicator program
