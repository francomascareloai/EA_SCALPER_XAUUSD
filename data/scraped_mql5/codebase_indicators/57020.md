**1. Overview** MeanReversionTrendEA combines trend following and mean reversion strategies using Moving Averages and ATR-based volatility measurements, with built-in trade validation to ensure reliable execution across various market conditions.

**2. Key Features**

* Dual Strategy: Combines trend following (MA crossovers) and mean reversion (price-to-MA deviations).
* Adaptive Signals: Uses fast and slow moving averages for trend identification.
* Volatility Integration: Incorporates ATR to measure market volatility for mean reversion entries.
* Built-in Validator: Comprehensive trade validation system checking volume, margin and stop levels.
* Safety Mechanism: Includes safety trade functionality for backtest validation.
* Defensive Position Management: Fixed or proportional SL/TP with proper validation.
* Multi-Asset Compatible: Works with forex, commodities, indices and stocks with proper lot sizing.

**3. How It Works**

* Monitors moving average crosses for trend direction changes.
* Measures price deviations from slow MA using ATR-based volatility bands.
* Generates buy signals when fast MA crosses above slow MA or price falls below volatility band.
* Generates sell signals when fast MA crosses below slow MA or price rises above volatility band.
* Validates and executes trades with proper risk management parameters.

**4. Inputs**

* Fast\_MA\_Period (20), Slow\_MA\_Period (50), ATR\_Period (14)
* ATR\_Multiplier (2.0) for mean reversion band calculation
* LotSize (0.1) for position sizing
* SL\_Points (500), TP\_Points (1000) for risk management
* Magic\_Number (123456) for order identification

**5. Usage Notes**

* Optimal for all major currency pairs and liquid instruments.
* Works on all timeframes, with H1-H4 recommended for better signal quality.
* Requires sufficient historical data for proper indicator calculation.
* Best for trending markets with occasional reversion opportunities.
* Robust validation system ensures proper execution across brokers.

**6. Code Structure**

* CTradeValidator: Comprehensive trade validation class.
* Indicator initialization and data processing functions.
* Signal generation combining trend and reversion logic.
* Trade execution with proper validation and risk management.
