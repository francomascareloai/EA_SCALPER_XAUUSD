The "Martin Gale Breakout" strategy is an Expert Advisor (EA) designed for trading in the Forex market. This EA combines a breakout trading approach with elements of the Martin Gale money management system to optimize trading performance.

**Input Parameters:**

* **TakeProfPoints:** This parameter allows you to set the Take Profit level in points for each trade.
* **BalancePercentageAvailable:** Specify the percentage of your account balance that will be used for trading.
* **TP\_Percentage\_of\_Balance:** It determines the percentage of your account balance to be used as Take Profit for each trade.
* **SL\_Percentage\_of\_Balance:** This sets the percentage of your balance to be allocated as the Stop Loss for trades.
* **Start\_The\_Recovery:** This parameter plays a crucial role in the recovery process, controlling when and how recovery measures are activated.
* **TP\_Points\_Multiplier:** A multiplier for Take Profit points, allowing for flexible profit-taking strategies.
* **MagicNumber:** An identifier unique to this EA, ensuring it can manage its own trades independently.

**Strategy Highlights:**

1. **Breakout Trading:** The EA specializes in identifying breakout opportunities in the market, where price movements breach key levels.
2. **Dynamic Lot Sizing:** Lot sizes are dynamically adjusted based on your account balance and risk preferences, following the Martin Gale money management principles.
3. **Loss Recovery:** The EA includes a powerful recovery mechanism designed to recover losses by adaptively modifying trade parameters when necessary.

The main function that is used in this EA is the CalcLotWithTP() function which has 3 input parameters: Takeprofit, Startprice, Endprice. It calculates the volume needed for the trade so that it achieves the profit goal when it enters a trade at the Startprice and exits at the Endprice.

Everything in the code is commented, so that the understanding of it is made easier.
