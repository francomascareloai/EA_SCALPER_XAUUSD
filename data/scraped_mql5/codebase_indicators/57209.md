This EA is truly random in nature. It randomly selects currency pairs, lot sizes, and order types. This EA does not rely on any technical skillset such as indicators, price action, news calendar events, or candlestick patterns. It offers multiple trading strategies, risk management plans, and other customizable settings.

Even though the EA works on randomness, it has still achieved good profits.

| **Variable** | **Values** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trading Strategy** | OneSide, DoubleSide | **OneSide:** The EA will take one trade, either Buy or Sell.   **DoubleSide:** The EA will take one Buy trade and one Sell trade. |
| **minLot\_Size** | Double Value | Minimum lot size to ensure lot size randomness does not go below this value. |
| **maxLot\_Size** | Double Value | Maximum lot size to ensure lot size randomness does not exceed this value. |
| **StopLoss** | Int Value | Set your stop loss value in points/pips (the smallest price movement unit for your asset).   Set Stop Loss to **0** to disable it. |
| **TakeProfit** | Int Value | Set your take profit value in points/pips.   Set Take Profit to **0** to disable it. |
| **Trailing\_Start** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Specify the number of pips from the open trade price at which trailing should begin.   Set Trailing Start to **0** to disable the trailing operation. |
| **Trailing\_Gap** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Set the gap in pips between the current market price and the trailing stop loss.   Set Trailing Gap to **0** to disable the trailing operation. |
| **Risk\_In\_Money\_Type** | FixedMoney, BalancePercentage | **FixedMoney:** Closes all open trades when the negative floating reaches your specified amount.   **BalancePercentage:** Automatically calculates based on your account balance and closes all trades once this limit is reached. |
| **Money\_In\_Risk** | Int Value | If **Risk\_In\_Money\_Type** is set to **FixedMoney**, enter the amount of money you can afford to lose.   If set to **BalancePercentage**, the EA will automatically calculate the risk based on your account balance and close all trades when that limit is reached. |
| **Max\_Spread** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Sets the maximum acceptable spread. If the current spread exceeds this value, the EA will not take a trade and will wait for the spread to return within the specified limit. |
| **Slippage** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Set the maximum allowed slippage for order execution. |

**Note:** If you are experiencing a malfunction or error in EA operation, remove  *#property strict*  from the EA code on line 8.

**Good Luck, Happy Trading!**
