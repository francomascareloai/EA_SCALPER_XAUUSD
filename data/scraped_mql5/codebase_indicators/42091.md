Going west going east trying to read the Fibonacci lines values or to find an Auto Fibonacci indicator in the MetaTrader! No Avail!

One of my clients asked my for an Expert Advisor that uses the Fibonacci lines and automatically find the Higher High and Lower Low between 2 bars (Start bar to Current Bar).

There's a lot of Fibonacci indicators out there but I decided to make my own indicator for you,

Hope you Enjoy it!

The indicator is badly written - it incorrectly draws retracements for an upward wave. Fibo retracements are always drawn in the direction of the wave. That is, for a downward wave from the peak (100%) to the minimum of the wave (0%), for an upward wave from the low (fibo 100%) to the top (fibo 0%). The second thing, it would be useful to add external retracements: 1.272 and 1.618.
