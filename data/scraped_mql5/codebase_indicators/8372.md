IndicatorDeleteOnDropped - the script for quick deletion of the indicator from the current chart window. Drag the script to the indicator to be deleted.

IndicatorPropertyFromWindow - the script calls the properties of the first indicator in the window which the script was dropped on.

IndicatorsReinit - the script for reinitialization of all indicators attached to the current window. The reinitialization is performed by a short-time timeframe changing.
