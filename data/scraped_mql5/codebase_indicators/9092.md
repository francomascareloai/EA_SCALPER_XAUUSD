This is a nice piece of work! But there are things I dont understand:

Could you explain how does the external variable work-e.g. what exactly should I input, to receive a calculation for last 6 months and last year?

Thanks in advance for explanations!

I've also found a minor error: e.g. when you put the script in [GBPJPY](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/gbpjpy "GBPJPY chart: technical analysis"), the script says that minimal value occurred on 20.07.2009 and actually it was a day earlier.

Cheers,

Tom

I was chnges script file (actual file Histo ranges\_v0.10.mq4).

Corrected errors in the determination of the date of the minimum and maximum [rank](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_characteristics/matrix_rank " MQL5 Documentation: function Rank").

Input for calculation:

- last 6 months :

> agoYear=0, agoMonth=6, agoWeek=0, agoDays=0

- last year :

1. agoYear=1, agoMonth=0, agoWeek=0, agoDays=0
2. agoYear=0, agoMonth=12, agoWeek=0, agoDays=0
3. agoYear=0, agoMonth=0, agoWeek=0, agoDays=365
4. agoYear=0, agoMonth=0, agoWeek=52, agoDays=1

- last 18 months :

1. agoYear=1, agoMonth=6, agoWeek=0, agoDays=0
2. agoYear=0, agoMonth=18, agoWeek=0, agoDays=0
