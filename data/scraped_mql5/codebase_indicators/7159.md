Emir Erdil:

Code that works again :)

Matze2886:

This is one of the most useless things I have ever seen in my life. The colors do not have any meaning.  If you look into the code you will see that the color switches after 10 candles.

Vladimir Karputov:

This is a tutorial example - an example of how to recolor areas of an indicator. It is on these examples that novice programmers learn.

sammcdj:

Is it possible to use only single data buffer array and maybe have a parallel color buffer array with which to color indicator ... Maintaining separate data buffers causes logical and tactical problem since buy/sell conditions are to be generated off comparing adjacent values of data buffer and signal generation need not be aligned with color.  No other trading related programming language has syntax that  requires programmers to maintain two data arrays just to be able to render different colors on screen.

Rethabile Fokase:

VERY USEFULL
