### Description:

This script opens a pending sell order by just point and drop the script in the place you want.

The script will automatically place a "limit sell order" if you point and drop above actual bid.  
The script will automatically place a "stop buy order" if you point and drop below actual bid.  
Before placing the pending order, a window will be open where you can modify lots, slippage, Stop Loss and Take Profit values.

IMPORTANT: You just need to specify Slippage, SL or TP in pips value and the script will automatically change the values if you are using 5 decimals prices multiplying by 10 the input values.

The script is very useful, just some drag and drop.

I rate it 9/10

I modify it using meta editor to use 0.01 lot size and also 0
stoploss, as that is the value I use most

I would recommend this in my blog

Thanks.

Great simple script, Thanks blackhawk - I wish you could add the trailing stop [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions") to it!

Hi blackhawk,

I know this discussion is quite old now but your code is indeed so simple and extremely useful. I use it all the time.

Do you have it also for MT5 (as an mq5 file)? Or do you know where I could eventually find it?

Thank you in advance.
