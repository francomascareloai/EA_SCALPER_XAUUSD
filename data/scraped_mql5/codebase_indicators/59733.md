### **Description:**

This indicator identifies **bullish and bearish engulfing candlestick patterns** on the chart and optionally confirms them with volume. When the volume of the current candle exceeds that of the previous one, the pattern is considered stronger and more reliable. The user can choose whether or not to apply this volume confirmation filter.

**External Inputs:**

* BullishArrowColor : Color of the arrow marking bullish engulfing patterns.
* BearishArrowColor : Color of the arrow marking bearish engulfing patterns.
* UseVolumeFilter : Enables or disables volume confirmation.

**How to Interpret:**  
 An arrow pointing upward below a candle indicates a bullish engulfing pattern, while a downward arrow above a candle indicates a bearish engulfing pattern. When volume confirmation is enabled, only engulfing patterns with increasing volume are shown.

Cleverly written code and good layout, it's a simple condition to detect the pattern and it works. I made an engulfing pattern detector before in a much different way, I measured candle sizes for the current and previous.

Thanks for the feedback! Measuring candle size is a great approach as well.

Add the ability to open trades when signal are generated,  with confirmation from the [moving averages](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "MetaTrader 5 Help: Moving Average indicator") , i think it would be cool 😁

And also What does someone need to study so that they can be able to code such things . Thanks

[Equity and Balance Indicator - History based](/en/code/59744)

This indicator reads the trade history and plots the Cumulative P & L over time, helping visual traders to see how much money they are making or losing over time.
This current version has a difference of 0.02% marginal error, due to rounding floats, and calculation methods. It can be considered extremely precise with this marginal error.
