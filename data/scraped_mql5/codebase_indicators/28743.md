This EA has 3 Very Interesting Functions:

1. It can Detect Trades and its modifications in the account, made by other EAs or made manually.

2. Once trades are detected, it can transmit each Trade over the web to any Server or any webapplication API (May require modification by
professional coder, depending on the API).

Currently using JSON type messages, but can be modified for any other format.

3.  Function TransmitTradeRequest can be used by other algorithms to replace the function "OnTrade" from mql5.
