Nowadays the script only works with [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"), I wanted to use it on my live account but it did not work at all, except demo account. Please, what is happening to the script?
