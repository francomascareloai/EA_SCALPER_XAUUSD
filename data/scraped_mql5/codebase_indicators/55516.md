**TD Sequential Ultimate MetaTrader indicator** shows all parts of the TD Sequential method developed by the legendary technical analyst, Tom DeMark. TD Sequential Ultimate displays Buy and Sell Setups, including the Setup Perfection arrows, Buy and Sell Countdowns, including the failed count 13 attempts, and TDST Support and Resistance levels. Unlike many other implementations of the TD Sequential method, this indicator offers multiple improvements:

## Input parameters

### Calculation

* **MaxBars** (default = 1000) — how many bars to calculate TD Sequential for. Zero value means that the indicator will calculate its counts for all available bars. The higher the number the slower the indicator will work.

### Display

* **BuySetupColor** (default = clrLime) — color of the Buy Setup counts and Perfection arrows.
* **SellSetupColor** (default = clrRed) — color of the Sell Setup counts and Perfection arrows.
* **CountdownColor** (default = clrOrange) — color of the Countdown values.
* **FontFace** (default = "Verdana") — font face to use for counts.
* **FontSize** (default = 12) — font size to use for counts.
* **ArrowWidth** (default = 2) — arrow size for Setup Perfection.
* **PixelDistance** (default = 3) — vertical distance between count objects in pixels.
* **Prefix** (default = "TDS\_") — text prefix for naming chart objects.

### Alerts

* **AlertOnSetup** (default = false) — trigger alert when Buy/Sell Setup is finished (count #9 is printed).
* **AlertOnPerfecting** (default = false) — trigger alert when Buy/Sell Setup is perfected (an arrow appears).
* **AlertOnCount13** (default = false) — trigger alert when Countdown candle #13 appears.
* **AlertOnSupportResistance** (default = false) — trigger alert when a candle closes above resistance or below support.
* **AlertNative** (default = false) — if *true*, then a native popup alert will be issued each time an alert event occurs.
* **AlertEmail** (default = false) — if *true*, alerts will be sent via email. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **AlertNotification** (default = false) — if *true*, alerts will be sent via push-notifications to your mobile device. You need to set up MetaQuotes ID in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications* for this to work properly.

![Support and Resistance MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Support and Resistance MT4](/en/code/55514)

Support and Resistance MetaTrader indicator — as the name of this indicator suggests, it displays the support and resistance levels. It shows them directly on the chart, providing an easy help when you want to set stop-loss or take-profit level, or when you want to see the next market target. This indicator uses the standard MetaTrader Fractals indicator (by Bill Williams' method) and has no changeable input parameters. This indicator is available for MetaTrader version 4 and 5.

![Spread indicator MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Spread indicator MT4](/en/code/55512)

Spread MetaTrader indicator — displays current spread in the main window of the chart. You can modify the font parameters, indicator's position and the normalization of the spread value. The spread is redrawn after each tick, ensuring the most current and active spread value. This can be useful for brokers with variable spreads or with spreads that are widened often. You can also enable a spread label to be shown near the current Bid line. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

![Total Power Indicator MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Total Power Indicator MT4](/en/code/55518)

Total Power Indicator (MetaTrader indicator) — is based on the two standard indicators — Bear Power and Bull Power. The indicator calculates how many bullish and bearish bars were there during a given look-back period and then calculates the proportional index for bears, bulls, and total (calculated as the absolute difference between bulls and bears) for the current bar. This way, we get continuous lines of the relative average bear and bull power over a period, removing the main disadvantage of the original Bear/Bull Power indicators — the lack of a long-term perspective. The original MetaTrader 4 version of Total Power Indicator was created by Daniel Fernandez of Asirikuy.com in 2011. The version for MT5 is now also available.

![Trade Assistant MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Trade Assistant MT4](/en/code/55520)

Trade Assistant MetaTrader indicator — a multi-timeframe indicator that is based on three standard indicators: Stochastic oscillator, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and CCI (Commodity Channel Index). It displays current trend directions for M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, W1, and MN1 timeframes. When you follow such an indicator you have a clear picture of the trends across all important timeframes. It doesn't matter which timeframe you attach this indicator to. The indicator can be downloaded for MT4 and MT5.
