This MT5 custom indicator, called "wd.Range\_DailyAvg.mq5".   
Basic idea is based on MT4 indicator 'TSR\_Ranges.mq4' by Ogeimais.  
   
It is designed to calculate the 'Average Daily Range' (ADR) based on 20 days of historical upper and lower price data.

**Here's how the indicator works:**  
  
    Input Parameters:  
        Display Average Range Information:   
        This input parameter controls whether to display the Average Range Information on the upper left chart.  
  
        Today's price zone color :   
        The color of the rectangle that represents the estimated price zone for the day.  
        User also can choose the border style and it's width.  
  
        Estimated today prize zone:   
        This allows user to choose the anchor for the estimated price zone.   
        User can select either 'Room\_up' or 'Room\_down' based on the market trend.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/152/wd.Range_DailyAvg_v2.23_uInputs_Tabo.jpg)

Number inside the rectangle shows the Average Daily Range (ADR). ADR is calculated based on the range of the previous day, averages for 2-day, 5-day, 10-day, and 20-day periods.  
Make sure to check the 'Show object description' option in MT5 Chart Properties.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/152/Chart_Properties.jpg)

If user believes that today's trend is upward and wants to estimate how many pips the price movement might take, user can set the 'Estimated today prize zone' to 'Room\_up.' In this case, the rectangle will determine today's lowest price and set the highest price based on the ADR.  
  
  
Overall, this indicator helps user estimate the potential price movement for the current day based on 20 days historical data and market trends.   
Depending on the selected anchor (Room\_up or Room\_down), it showing potential profit-taking or buying/selling price levels.   
The indicator provides a visual representation of the estimated price zone as a colored rectangle on the chart, making it easier for users to make trading decisions.

**mauro bianchi [#](/en/forum/456904#comment_54127449):**  
 Hi I wanted to know if it is possible to get avg range for each day of the week, (last 10/20/30 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc), it could interest me. If you can add this to the wonderful indicator I think it would be useful

Good idea. In next release, I might add this new feature.

Every range calculation is off by one point. For the benefit of those who may not know how to verify the accuracy of the range: it can be checked via the Data Window by calculating the range for any particular day (subtracting the Low from the High), then summing the daily ranges over the relevant number of days, and finally dividing that total by the number of days.

The included screenshot shows the previous day's High as 294.81 and the Low as 272.37, resulting in a range of 2.44 or 244 points. However, the indicator returns 243 points. This one-point discrepancy is carried through the rest of the calculations.

A small and seemingly insignificant error—but an error nonetheless.

Very short edit time !

For consideration

```mql5
input int   prevXDays   = 20; //  Prev Days - Daily AV 

int OnCalculate()
{
  
  double rangeToDay=0, rangePrevDay=0, rangePrevXDays=0;

  rangeToDay =(iHigh(NULL, PERIOD_D1, 0)-iLow(NULL, PERIOD_D1, 0))/_Point; 
  rangePrevDay =(iHigh(NULL, PERIOD_D1, 1)-iLow(NULL, PERIOD_D1, 1))/_Point;
  
  for(int x=1;x<=prevXDays;x++) rangePrevXDays += (iHigh(NULL,PERIOD_D1,x)-iLow(NULL,PERIOD_D1,x))/_Point; 
  
  rangePrevXDays /= prevXDays;

}
```

Not the optimal edit time window for busy people !

The above code can be tested for accuracy:

1. Set prevXDays = 1. The code return should match the Data Widow High - Low range for the previous day.
2. Set pevXDays = 5. From the Data Window Sum the High - Low range for the previous 5 days and divide the sum by 5. The code return should match the manual calculation.
