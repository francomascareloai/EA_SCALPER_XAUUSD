Scripts perform one-time actions in MetaTrader 5 using an MQL5 program and are deleted from the chart immediately afterwards. Sample functions include uploading trading history, generating a report and sending it by email, downloading and processing data from a file. Scripts can also be used to create graphical interface or quickly execute single-type trading operations, for example, close all positions immediately.

You can download and launch offered scripts in MetaTrader 5. The library of scripts is also available directly from MetaEditor development environment allowing you to learn MQL5 programming.
