### **Key Features**

   * When the MACD crosses above or below the zero line.
   * The strength and direction of the trend.
2. ---

   **Customisable Sound Alerts:**   
    Receive real-time notifications whenever important crossings occur between the MACD and the signal line or when the MACD crosses the zero region. You can configure

   * The sound of the alert.
   * The maximum number of repetitions.
   * The minimum pause between alerts.
3. ---

   **Configurable colours:**   
    The indicator uses a rich and intuitive colour palette to highlight different states of the MACD, signal line and histogram. The colours are easy to interpret and help in making quick decisions.
4. ---

   **Customisable parameters** :

   * Periods of the fast and slow moving averages.

5. ---

   **User-friendly interface:**   
    The indicator is easy to set up and use, even for beginner traders. All parameters can be adjusted directly in the properties window.
