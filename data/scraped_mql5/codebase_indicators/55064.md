This Expert Advisor (EA) demonstrates how to use the MQL5 Calendar to create an automated trading system that reacts to high-impact forex news events. The main goal of this code is educational: to teach traders and developers how to interact with the MQL5 Calendar to identify and trade around significant economic news releases, such as inflation data (CPI/PPI) or interest rate decisions.  
The EA uses the MQL5 Calendar functions to identify upcoming news events relevant to the symbol being traded. If a high-impact event is detected for the base or quote currency, the EA implements a breakout trading strategy by placing pending orders (Buy Stop and Sell Stop) above and below the current price. This approach aims to capture price movements driven by volatility from news releases.

Unfortunately, I discovered that some brokers are a bit sloppy with the server time
change due to the daylight saving time (DST), which I did not expect and which surprised me a lot.
Here is a script with which anyone can check their broker.
