## SuperTrend Indicator – Precise Trend Detection Made Simple

### **Overview**

The **SuperTrend Indicator** is a powerful, easy-to-use tool that overlays directly on your price chart to provide real-time trend direction and high-probability entry/exit signals. Perfect for scalpers, swing traders, and intraday strategies, it dynamically adjusts to market volatility using **ATR (Average True Range)** and reacts quickly to trend reversals.

---

### **Key Features**

* Real-time trend shifts with colored signals
* Clear buy/sell signals based on price crossing the trend line
* Built-in smoothing to filter out market noise
* Works on all timeframes and all instruments (Forex, stocks, crypto, indices)
* Ideal for both beginners and advanced traders
* Can be combined with any strategy (EMA, price action, support/resistance)

---

### **Input Parameters**

| Parameter | Description |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ATR Period | Defines how many bars to calculate the Average True Range. Default: 10 |  |
| Multiplier | The factor applied to ATR to offset the SuperTrend line. Default: 3.0 |  |
| Price Type | Chooses which price to apply ATR on (e.g., Close, High/Low, etc.) |  |
| Line Width | Thickness of the SuperTrend line |  |
| Color Settings | Customize uptrend/downtrend colors for better visibility |  |

---

### 

### --- **How to Use**

* **Buy Signal:** Price closes **above** the SuperTrend line → trend is bullish
* **Sell Signal:** Price closes **below** the SuperTrend line → trend is bearish
* Combine with other confirmations for best results (e.g., RSI, EMA, candlestick patterns)

---

### **Best Practices**

* Use on **H1 or higher** for cleaner trend detection
* Add **ATR** or **Volume** indicators for additional context
* Use as **confirmation** in a multi-indicator strategy or standalone for trend-following

---

### Take Your Trading to the Next Level

The **SuperTrend Indicator** helps you stay on the right side of the market and reduce noise. Whether you trade breakouts, trends, or pullbacks, this tool brings clarity and precision to your charts.

Hello,  
  
I am facing one challenge on Supertrend Indicator as below,  
  
I am using supertrend of 15min but on 1 min chart. Multiple time I have observed the trend(which is shown by indicator) is wrong here. I decided to copare with trading view chart and it was clearly visible. Multiple times on tradingview the supertrend is positive and in our MT5 code it was bearish. I am totally confused why this is happening. if you can help will be really appreciated.  
  
Thanks

Regards,

Hitesh Daiya

I really enjoyed seeing the code.
It's a good indicator; in fact, I have it live implemented in an EA.
I'd like to see better results, but I'm happy to achieve positive results.
Thank you very much,
