One more in the series of experiments with a variable length super
smoother. In this case adaptive super smoother is used for price pre
filtering before it is used to calculate a stochastic. At a first glance
it looks usable and tradeable (clean enough to help in trend finding).
Some experimenting with parameters for specific symbols and time frames
is advised. Since it is so smooth, decided to put default overbought
and oversold levels rather high and low — adjust it to your prefences
and trading style.
