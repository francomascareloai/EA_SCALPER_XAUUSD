**Indicator Name**   : Kuskus Starlight

**Description**   :   
 Kuskus Starlight is a technical indicator that functions as an oscillator, utilizing a Fisher price transformation to assist traders in identifying potential market trends and reversals. It is normalized over a specified range of periods, with adjustable smoothing parameters to tailor its responsiveness. This indicator is particularly valued for its role as a confirmation tool within trading systems, aiding in validating potential trade signals.

**Background**   :   
 I discovered the Kuskus Starlight indicator through Stonehill Forex and the No Nonsense Forex (NNFX) YouTube channel. Both platforms highlight their utility as a confirmation indicator within their trading systems. According to Stonehill Forex, the indicator dates back to 2007, while NNFX references its release in 2017.

For a detailed overview and application of the Kuskus Starlight indicator, you can refer to the following resources:

* Stonehill Forex's article:  [Kuskus  Starlight  as  a  Confirmation  Indicator](/go?link=https://stonehillforex.com/2024/01/kuskus-starlight-as-a-confirmation-indicator/ "https://stonehillforex.com/2024/01/kuskus-starlight-as-a-confirmation-indicator/")
* NNFX's YouTube video:  [Kuskus  Starlight  Indicator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMZd-6jUVFo "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMZd-6jUVFo")

**Why I Coded It**   :   
 As a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) user, I was unable to find a version of the Kuskus Starlight indicator compatible with MT5. Recognizing its potential value for traders in the MT5 environment, I took the initiative to code it myself, ensuring that its functionality and integrity align with the original algorithm.

**Original MT4 Code and Algorithm**   :   
 The original version of this indicator, designed for MetaTrader 4 (MT4), was posted by Scriptor and can be found here:  [Kuskus  Starlight  - MQL4  Code  Base](/en/code/8365). My MT5 adaptation is based on this code and preserves its core principles while making it accessible to the MT5 community.

I hope this MT5 version of Kuskus Starlight proves to be a valuable addition to your trading toolkit!

Thank you appreciate the effort, it is fun to retest these results, the NNFX group was what brought me to this market :)  ,I think the w/l ratios they published are long gone though

Nice repaint indicator. I wasted 1 day [backtesting](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks ") this on closed market, only to find it repainting on live market. Nice entertainment for me over the weekend. :)

Hope you make a non-repaint version of it too.
