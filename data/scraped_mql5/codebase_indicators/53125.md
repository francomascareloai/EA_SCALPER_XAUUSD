The indicator WeekDays displays Day Of Week, Week Of Year, Day Of Year or Bar Index in the Data Window, and optionally in labels on the chart.

As usual, the information in the Data Window is updated dynamically according to mouse movements: the name of the day is always promptly updated in the left column, whereas the content of the right column is defined by the settings, specifically the inputs *WholePart* and *FractionalPart*. Each of them allows user to select one of the entities to display: Day Of Week, Week Of Year, Day Of Year, Bar Index, or None.

* *WholePart* - selector for the number in front of the floating point;
* *FractionalPart* - selector for the number after the floating point;

Two selected properties (integer numbers) are combined into a single floating point value for every bar and stored in the indicator buffer. Of course, the buffer made invisible on the chart due to DRAW\_NONE style, because its values are synthetic.

For example, for the screenshot below the name of the day is Tue, and the buffer containing Week.DoY (Day Of Year index) shows value 44.302, that is 44-th week and 302-th day of the year, respectively.

The other inputs allows user to specify whether or not to *ShowLabels* on chart, what *FontName*, *FontSize*, *FontColor* to use, as well as *Padding* from top/bottom edges, how to *Align* them (top/middle/bottom), and optional *RotationAngle* for middle alignment.

Default clrNONE for FontColor means reverse color for current chart background.

Thanks for the handy tool.

I have a suggestion (may be an option that can changed by user) to display the bar index start counting from bar 0 as "the most recent" bar.

It will be compatible with the "start position" parameter in timeseries functions like iTime() and CopyRates().

Thank you for the proposition, but this feature was deliberately eliminated (and indexing goes from left to right), because it would require to update all values in the buffer upon every new bar formation. Current approach writes increased numbers into the last bar only.

The pity is that you didn't download and install the two include files provided, before trying to compile.

![AutoFibo indicator of two last swings based on ZigZag](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[AutoFibo indicator of two last swings based on ZigZag](/en/code/53041)

The AutoFibo indicator is an advanced Fibonacci retracement tool that automatically draws Fibonacci levels based on the ZigZag pattern. This indicator is designed to help traders quickly identify potential support and resistance levels in trending markets.

![Swap Monitor](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/services.png)
[Swap Monitor](/en/code/53007)

This service periodically checks swaps for predefined symbols and saves detected changes into CSV-files for further analysis and potential replay (not implemented here). Also it monitors and alerts swap changes of existing positions.

![Hammer Indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Hammer Indicator](/en/code/53154)

The code above is a "Hammer" indicator that detects candlestick hammer formations (bullish and bearish) and inverted hammer formations (bullish and bearish) on a MetaTrader 5 chart. This indicator identifies price reversal patterns by calculating the size and ratio of the candlestick wicks based on adjustable parameters: MaxRatioShortWick, MinRatioLongWick, and MinCandleSize. When a pattern is detected, the indicator displays a colored arrow near the candle’s lowest or highest price according to the pattern’s direction. The code also includes functions to create and delete objects automatically when the indicator is initialized or stopped.
