[![screenshot of macd-v](https://c.mql5.com/18/171/Screenshot_2025-11-19_at_4_19_563PM.png "screenshot of macd-v")](https://c.mql5.com/18/171/Screenshot_2025-11-19_at_4_19_569PM.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/171/Screenshot_2025-11-19_at_4_19_569PM.png")

This indicator is based on the principles of *MACD-v: Volatility Normalised Momentum*, a research paper authored by Alex Spiroglou in 2022. In that work, which received the **Charles H. Dow Award (2022)** from the CMT Association and the **Founders Award (2022)** for advances in active investment management, Spiroglou presented a refined interpretation of momentum by incorporating volatility-aware behaviour into a MACD-style framework. Inspired by this concept, the indicator here adapts the traditional MACD structure to provide clearer transitions, more stable signals and improved visual interpretation during periods of varying volatility.

The indicator computes a fast and slow moving average of the selected price source, derives the MACD line as their difference, and forms a smoothed signal line. The histogram represents the gap between MACD and signal, which helps to identify momentum build-up, exhaustion, and early trend shifts. Crossovers and histogram expansion serve as primary trade-timing cues. Zero-line interaction reveals broader momentum regime changes, while contraction warns of potential reversals or consolidation phases.

Interpretation remains consistent with standard MACD theory, while providing a more balanced response to volatility. A MACD line crossing above the signal suggests rising bullish momentum; crossing below signals growing bearish momentum. Histogram expansion indicates acceleration, whereas flattening signals deceleration. Divergences between price and histogram may highlight weakening trends. The indicator functions effectively across all liquid symbols and timeframes, though confirmation with a higher-timeframe trend filter is recommended for robustness.

**External variables**

```mql5
* FastLen: Period for fast EMA in MACD-v numerator.
* SlowLen: Period for slow EMA; paired with fast to form spread.
* SignalLen: EMA smoothing length for the signal line.
* ATRPeriod: ATR lookback used to normalize MACD spread (volatility scaling).
* MaxBarsBack: Limit on historical bars processed (0 = use all available).
* ShowHistogram: Toggles rendering of MACD-v minus signal histogram.
* ShowLevels: Enables creation of predefined horizontal level lines.
```

These variables enable users to tailor sensitivity, display, and alert behaviour to the trading style. No symbol-specific configuration is required; it is suitable for all markets.

**Recommended use**  
 The indicator may be applied on any timeframe. Intraday traders may prefer M15–H1, while swing or position traders will find H4–D1 advantageous. Combining the indicator with a trend filter significantly reduces noise and enhances cross-direction accuracy. The histogram is especially useful for assessing momentum exhaustion and identifying potential reversals when expansion slows.

[ZigZag HH HL LH LL Pattern Label Indicator (MT4)](/en/code/66106)

This indicator is an enhanced version of the standard ZigZag used in MetaTrader 4.
It automatically detects and labels structural price points: Higher High (HH),
Higher Low (HL), Lower High (LH), and Lower Low (LL). The indicator draws trend
lines between ZigZag points and prints the market structure on the chart in real time.
Useful for:
• Market structure analysis (HH, HL, LH, LL)
• Pattern recognition (Head & Shoulders, Quasimodo, Break of Structure)
• Trend continuation / reversal confirmation
• Dashboard scanners and multi-timeframe systems
The code has been optimized to remove warnings, uses only MQL4-compatible
functions, and ensures clean object management with timeframe tagging.
Suitable for manual traders, system builders, and EA developers.
