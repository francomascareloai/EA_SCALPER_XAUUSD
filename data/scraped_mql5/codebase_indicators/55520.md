**Trade Assistant MetaTrader indicator** — a multi-timeframe indicator that is based on three standard indicators: Stochastic oscillator, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and CCI (Commodity Channel Index). It displays current trend directions for M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, W1, and MN1 timeframes. When you follow such an indicator you have a clear picture of the trends across all important timeframes. It doesn't matter which timeframe you attach this indicator to. The indicator can be downloaded for MT4 and MT5.

## Input parameters

* **CheckCandle** (default = Previous) — which candle to check indicator values on — works for both display and alerts.
* **PercentK** (default = 8) — the period in bars for calculation of the line %K of Stochastic indicator.
* **PercentD** (default = 3) — the period in bars for calculation of the line %D of Stochastic indicator.
* **Slowing** (default = 3) — the value for slowing of Stochastic indicator.
* **RSIP1** (default = 14) — the period for the first RSI (fast).
* **RSIP2** (default = 70) — the period for the second RSI (slow).
* **Enable** (default = false/true) — if *true*, Trade Assistant calculates and displays signals for a given timeframe.
* **EnableNativeAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, a native MetaTrader popup alert will be used when a confluence of signals appear for some of the timeframes.
* **EnableEmailAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent when a confluence of signals appear for some of the timeframes. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **EnablePushAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent when a confluence of signals appear for some of the timeframes. Notifications should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications*.
* **Other parameters** — symbol codes for trend direction arrows and colors.

![Total Power Indicator MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Total Power Indicator MT4](/en/code/55518)

Total Power Indicator (MetaTrader indicator) — is based on the two standard indicators — Bear Power and Bull Power. The indicator calculates how many bullish and bearish bars were there during a given look-back period and then calculates the proportional index for bears, bulls, and total (calculated as the absolute difference between bulls and bears) for the current bar. This way, we get continuous lines of the relative average bear and bull power over a period, removing the main disadvantage of the original Bear/Bull Power indicators — the lack of a long-term perspective. The original MetaTrader 4 version of Total Power Indicator was created by Daniel Fernandez of Asirikuy.com in 2011. The version for MT5 is now also available.
