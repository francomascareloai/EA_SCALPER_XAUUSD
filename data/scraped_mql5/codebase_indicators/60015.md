SniperJaw EA is a one-trade-at-a-time robot that uses the Alligator indicator (Jaw, Teeth, Lips) to follow the trend.

You can control the trade size with LotSize, choose to close trades on opposite signal with UseEntryToExit, or use TakeProfit and StopLoss in pips if set. Slippage is managed by Slippage, and trading can be turned on or off using TradeEnabled. Alligator settings like JawPeriod, JawShift, TeethPeriod, TeethShift, LipsPeriod, and LipsShift let you adjust how the indicator works.

Hi !

 I tested on XM tester width GoldMicro 5M 2022.01.01-2025.06.20

It made one optimalization, and some simple run, then

stop without run, say file load wrong.

When i restart my computer, then can repeat it.

it not reset. )

Besides this the program made good result.

[2 Moving Averages](/en/code/59976)

2 Moving Averages is a custom MQL4 indicator that uses two moving averages (fast and slow) to identify potential trend changes and generate buy or sell signals based on crossover points. It enhances signal reliability by optionally integrating support and resistance levels, helping traders confirm entry and exit zones. This tool is suitable for trend-following strategies and works across multiple time frames.

It supports both buy and sell pending orders with user-configurable distance (in pips), lot size, and take profit levels. The EA maintains up to 10 pending orders per side, placing sell stop orders below the market and buy stop orders above, ideal for scalping strategies on any timeframe. Includes order management by MagicNumber to avoid conflicts with other EAs or manual trades.
