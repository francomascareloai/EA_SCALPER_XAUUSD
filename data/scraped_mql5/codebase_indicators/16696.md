T3 indicator that is using floating levels as an aid to determine the trend

---

Indicator is
made to be using extended set (22 types) of prices, and since it is using
floating levels, it can change colors (and alert accordingly), using 3
different conditions :

* when outer levels are crossed
* when middle (zero) level is crossed
* when the slope of T3 changes

It is already multi time frame (with the usual set of all available time frames in metatrader 5 - no need for some other indicator in order to have this version work in multi time frame mode)

---

Additional information about the "original T3" option was provided by the authors of the T3 modification (it was originally first applied on another trading platform) :

By Bob Fulks, modified by Alex Matulich 4/2003  
  
The
T3 Average is essentially a low-pass filter, as are the traditional
moving average and exponential moving average. The T3 Average, however,
exhibits a steeper rolloff, resulting in better  filtering of
high-frequency noise while better preserving the low-frequency
components of a time series.

With the addition of floating levels, the T3 usage can be extended to what it is normally used (as a kind of average). Floating levels are making it a kind of an "on chart oscillator" and then it can be used with floating "significant levels of what is usually referred to as "over bought" and "over sold" levels, but the recommendation is not to use them in that way, but as a signal for a new trend forming or a previously established trend confirmation
