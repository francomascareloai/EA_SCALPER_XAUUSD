 Reverse Engineered RSI projects traditional RSI levels — 30, 50, and 70 — directly onto the price chart instead of the oscillator window.

This lets traders see where RSI overbought, oversold, and equilibrium zones align with actual market prices,

making it easier to spot precise support, resistance, and potential reversal levels without switching views or relying on hidden momentum data.

Good work Mario. Just a problem with updating to include new bar. The lines don't extend with new bars.

Excelent work! To get nicer inputs for price, you can:
input ENUM\_APPLIED\_PRICE Price = PRICE\_CLOSE;
