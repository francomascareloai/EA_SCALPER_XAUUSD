This script calculates the total unbalanced postion of hedged or non hedged postions and then place hedge trades accordingly.

Example

trader places 0.01 lot then 0.02 lot buy trade

if then try to run the script , it will place 0.03 lot sell trade

if again a sell trade is placed of lot size 0.05 size and again we try to run the script, then it will place 0.05 lot buy trade.
