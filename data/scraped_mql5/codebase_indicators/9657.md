These are 3 very very simple scripts that simplify operation for scalpers.

OrderBuy and OrderSell puts new Order. CloseAllPositive close all order in the window with profit>1pip.

I found that are very useful if you config the Hotkey, for example i had configured ALT-Q for OrderBuy, ALT-A for OrderSell, ALT-W for CloseAllPositive.

You can change values in the scripts as you prefer.

  
  

Regards.

There are problems with non integer lots, here a corrected version.

[Copy files](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/files/filecopy "MQL5 documentation: FileCopy function") in the experts\scripts folder, then restart mt4. So in the navigation window you should view the scripts in programs branch. Click dx and assign hotkey.
