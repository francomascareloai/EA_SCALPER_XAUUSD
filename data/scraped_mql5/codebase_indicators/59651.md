The rules are:

* if you have less than n-positions open the EA will do nothing.
* the moment you open the n-th position the EA will close all previous positions if their total PnL is positive.
* if you have greater(or equal) than n-positions it will close everything as soon as the total PnL is positive.

 The rules above guarantee that you won't grow a too large basket that cause risk to your capital. Also it will help you with saving profit every now and then.

Note that the positions have to have same amount of risk(not necessarily lot size as the volatility could be different on different instruments).
