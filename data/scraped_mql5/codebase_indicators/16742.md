The "auto" addition is because this indicator in fact does that: shows a
correlation to itself. So it is an auto-correlation version of Spearman
rank indicator. Added Zones (for easier spotting of upper or lower level
crossing) as well as the usual Heiken Ashi choices of prices. Here is
an example with Heiken Ashi average (ha open+ha close+ha high+ha low/4)
price used in calculation.
