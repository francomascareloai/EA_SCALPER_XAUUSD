# MQL5 Source Codes of Libraries for MetaTrader 5 - 4

![icon](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/code-icon.png)

Libraries are small sub-programs containing a certain functionality that can then be used for developing new applications. Once written and thoroughly checked, a library allows users to speed up the development of new MQL5 applications. One of the illustrative examples is ALGLIB library containing multiple numerical analysis functions.

Library source codes can be downloaded and used in MetaEditor when developing trading strategies. They cannot be launched in MetaTrader 5 independently.

[CSV file reader for MQL5](/en/code/24777 "CSV file reader for MQL5")

This class was developed to exchange data between MetaTrader 5 and CSV files. It converts the strings read from the CSV file to double and integer values depending of the type of the columns.
Two producers of CSV files are most important for me. The most important producer are spreadsheet programs,
i.e. LibreCalc. Manually entered CSV are the other kind of CSV files I had in mind.
Be aware that this class do not use the standard library FileCsv.mqh etc. Instead it works with text files. It splits text lines into fields.
Maximum speed and low memory usage were no development goals. This class may not be suited for large datasets or time critical operations. I would not use CSV files if speed was my main goal.
