This a modified version of the i-session indicator by Igor Kim.

original code: https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/7419

Changes I added:

1. Isolated only the Asian session.

2. Allow users to modify settings such as Asian time in their local time, color of the boxes, and whether to fill boxes or not.

3. Removed the names of the boxes.

4. All drawings will disappear once indicator is removed from the chart.

Good indicator to highlight the [Asian Session](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/4102 "Article: Asian Overnight Trading: How to Stay Profitable ") on MT5.However, it does not give one the opportunity to load it again on the same chart with different timing for the London session while the earlier one loaded(Asian timing)is still on chart.Each time I try it, I only see the one for the Asian Session timing that stays on chart. If this function is allowed, one can load the indicator three times at the same time on a chart to show the 3 main sessions. It would be great to have that allowed on a new version. I got similar indicator to yours from somewhere online. It allows me to load it three times on same chart same time with different timings on the MT4 and it makes it cleaner than the i-sessions indicator from where you extracted this. Please enable the function for your indicator to be loaded more than once at the same time on a chart with different timings.Thank you.
