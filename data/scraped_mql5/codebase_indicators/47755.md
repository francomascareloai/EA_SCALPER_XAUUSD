Interesting!
Push all data to an Datalake and run som AI to find [correlations](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_products/matrix_correlate "MQL5 Documentation: function Correlate") that works :)

Now I wished I did my math homework in school better :)

Have someone pushed this kind of data to an AI and searched for [correlations](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_products/matrix_correlate "MQL5 Documentation: function Correlate")? Would be interesting to see results of this?  
Would it not be good to have Symbol, timeframe, date, time, weekday on it also ?  
  
I know there are some online AI engines like obviously.AI etc.. I got hungry to play with this even if I am not an expert at all..  
  
If someone have tips on the subject or links to where to play with this kind of datasets?  
  
Thanks for sharing

First of all, I would like to extend my personal compliments to the author of this script who is piquing my curiosity for further exploration of the topic. To this end, I would like to ask two questions regarding: 1) which prices are used to calculate the indicators; 2) I understand that the "buffer\_size" variable on line 18 of the script represents the depth of the archive that is created in the csv file, is this correct?
Thank you for your help and congratulations to the author for the work done.
