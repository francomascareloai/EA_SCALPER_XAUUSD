We add the indicator to the chart, save the template under the name "default".

Now all newly opened charts will open with this indicator.

I have a question, is it possible to limit the chart to not go extra beyond high and low (max min price) when scrolling mouse, just like default, Thanks

You squeezed the scale and then scrolled through the graph.

Double clicking LMB on the scale will fix everything.

A update of the indicator. Added a timeline. Cursor synchronization has also been added on different charts, regardless of the time frame.

Amazing Man !! Thank you for sharing. Can we modify the script so that it shows the price as integers? For example our broker provides the price of a symbol with 2 decimal points such as 86567,56 and by rounding to an integer on the price scale it shows this price as 86568

The AK-47 Scalper EA is fully automated. It employs a strategy of continuously entering Sell Stop orders and will modify them when the price moves against the pending orders.
