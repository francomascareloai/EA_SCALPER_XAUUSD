Semaphore signal indicator based on the [relative smoothed rate of price change](/en/code/16060).

The indicator uses SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library classes (copy it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Include). The use of the classes was thoroughly described in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).

Originally this indicator has been written in MQL4 and was first published in the [Code Base](/en/code/7968) on 08.03.2008.
