**Market Profile MetaTrader indicator** — is a classic Market Profile implementation that can show the price density over time, outlining the most important price levels, value area, and control value of a given trading session. This indicator can be attached to timeframes between M1 and D1 and will show the Market Profile for daily, weekly, monthly, or even intraday sessions. Lower timeframes offer higher precision. Higher timeframes are recommended for better visibility. It is also possible to use a free-draw rectangle session to create a custom market profile on any timeframe. Six different color schemes are available to draw the profile's blocks. Drawing profiles as a plain color histogram is also possible. Alternatively, you may choose to color the profile based on bullish/bearish bars. This indicator is based on bare price action and does not use any standard indicators. It is available for MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5

## Input parameters

### Main

* **Session** (default = Daily) — trading session for market profile: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Intraday, and Rectangle. For a rectangle session to get calculated, a rectangle chart object with the name starting with *MPR* should be added to the chart. Pressing 'r' on the keyboard will add a properly named rectangle object automatically.
* **StartFromDate** (default = \_\_DATE\_\_) — if **StartFromCurrentSession** is *false*, then the indicator will start drawing profiles from this date. It draws to the past. For example, if you set it 2018-01-20 and **SessionsToCount** is 2, then it will draw the profiles for 2018-01-20 and 2018-01-19.
* **StartFromCurrentSession** (default = true) — if *true*, then the indicator starts drawing from today, else — from the date given in **StartFromDate**.
* **SessionsToCount** (default = 2) — for how many trading sessions to draw the market profiles.
* **SeamlessScrollingMode** (default = false) — if *true*, the **StartFromDate** and **StartFromCurrentSession** parameters are ignored; the sessions are calculated and displayed starting from the current chart position's rightmost bar. This allows scrolling back in time indefinitely to view past sessions.
* **EnableDevelopingPOC** (default = false) — if *true*, multiple horizontal lines will be drawn to depict how the Point of Control developed through the session.
* **EnableDevelopingVAHVAL** (default = false) — if *true*, multiple horizontal lines will be drawn to depict how the Value Area High and Value Area Low developed through the session.
* **ValueAreaPercentage** (default = 70) — a percentage share of the session's TPOs to include in the Value Area.

The indicator is causing the candlestick draw to be delayed, and the bid and ask are not matching on the current candlestick. This issue is most prevalent on the 1-[minute timeframe](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_timeframes "MQL5 documentation: Chart Timeframes"), and the metatrader is randomly crashing.

Keltner Channel (MetaTrader indicator) — is a classical technical analysis indicator developed by Chester W. Keltner in 1960. The indicator is somewhat similar to the Bollinger Bands and Envelopes. It uses three plot lines: the middle line is the 10-day simple moving average applied to the typical price ((high + low + close) / 3), the upper and the lower bands are produced by adding and subtracting the moving average of the daily price range (High and Low difference) from the middle line. This way, a volatility-based channel is built. In this version of the indicator you can modify all the parameters of the MA. The indicator is available both for MT4 and MT5 versions of the platform.
