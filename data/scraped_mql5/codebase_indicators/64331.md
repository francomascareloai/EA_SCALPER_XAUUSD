MetaTrader’s default moving average indicator does not include alerts for crossovers. This means traders often miss good opportunities unless they are glued to the screen.

**CrossFire Alert** solves this problem. It’s a powerful moving average crossover indicator that instantly notifies you when two MAs cross, so you never miss a signal.

With CrossFire Alert you can:

* Display two customizable moving averages directly on your chart.
* Get instant alerts (on-screen, email, or push notifications).
* Choose between different MA types (Simple, Exponential, Smoothed, Weighted, etc.).
* Adjust period, shift, colors, and signal display.
* See buy/sell arrows whenever a crossover occurs.

### 

### Why Use CrossFire Alert?

* Helps you spot fresh trends and reversals in real time.
* Works in both trend-following and reversal strategies.
* Flexible settings allow you to adapt it to any pair or timeframe.
* Saves time by sending alerts so you don’t need to monitor the charts constantly.

[Trade By Retail Sentiment](/en/code/62627)

This Expert Advisor uses retail trader sentiment from the Ziwox API to implement a contrarian trading strategy, taking trades opposite to the majority of retail positions. By combining sentiment data with a moving average trend filter, it identifies potential market reversals and avoids crowded trades. The EA automatically fetches and parses sentiment in real-time, executes buy or sell orders based on contrarian logic, and displays clear visual indicators of retail long and short ratios directly on the chart, providing traders with both actionable signals and market insight.
