MT4:

1. Do not assume history has only closed orders.

2. Do not assume history is ordered by date, it's not.

3. Total Profit is *OrderProfit() + OrderSwap() + OrderCommission()*. Some brokers don't use the Commission/Swap fields. Instead, they add balance entries. (Maybe related to Government required accounting/tax laws.)

Added check for OrderType() 6 and 7 , if we filter it with symbol and magic number then it is not required but for normal scenario we need it. Thanks for pointing out
