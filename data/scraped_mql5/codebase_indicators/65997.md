### **Clean Market Watch Script**

**BEFORE :**                                                                                                                                                                                               **SECONDS After :**

### 

### 

The **Clean Market Watch** script is a simple utility tool designed to quickly remove all symbols from your MetaTrader 5 Market Watch window with a single click. This is particularly useful when you want to start fresh with a clean workspace or when your Market Watch has become cluttered with too many symbols.

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/171/6160739090469__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/171/6160739090469.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/171/6160739090469.png")

## Purpose

Over time, traders often accumulate numerous symbols in their Market Watch window, making it difficult to focus on the instruments they actively trade. Manually removing symbols one by one can be tedious and time-consuming. This script automates the entire process, clearing all symbols in seconds. It's also useful for removing persistent symbols that  refuse to be deleted from the market watch window due to being programmatically added.

## How It Works

The script operates using a simple but effective algorithm:

* **Iterative removal process** - The script loops through all symbols currently displayed in Market Watch and removes them systematically
* **Reverse order processing** - Symbols are removed from bottom to top to avoid index shifting issues that could cause symbols to be skipped
* **Safety mechanism** - A built-in iteration limit prevents infinite loops in case of unexpected errors
* **Real-time feedback** - Each removed symbol is logged to the Experts journal, allowing you to track the cleaning process
* **Completion notification** - A message box displays the total number of symbols removed upon completion

## Key Features

* **One-click operation** - Simply attach the script to any chart and it executes immediately
* **Safe execution** - Built-in safeguards prevent system issues
* **Detailed logging** - All operations are logged for transparency
* **No configuration needed** - Works out of the box with no input parameters required

## Usage Instructions

1. Open MetaTrader 5 terminal
2. Navigate to the Navigator window
3. Locate the **CleanMarketWatch** script under the Scripts folder
4. Drag and drop the script onto any chart, or double-click to execute
5. Wait for the completion message confirming all symbols have been removed

## Technical Details

The script uses the SymbolSelect() function with a false parameter to remove symbols from Market Watch. It processes symbols in reverse order starting from the highest index, ensuring stable array indexing throughout the removal process. Multiple iterations handle any symbols that may not be removed on the first pass.

## Recommended Use Cases

* Cleaning up before starting a new trading session
* Removing demo or test symbols after Back-testing
* Preparing a clean workspace for new trading strategies
* Resetting Market Watch after importing symbol lists
* Clearing Persistent Symbol List which cannot be manually deleted

## Important Notes

After running this script, your Market Watch will be completely empty. You will need to manually add back any symbols you wish to monitor. The script does not affect your trading history, open positions, or pending orders—it only modifies the Market Watch display.

This is true. I work with advanced custom symbols but nowhere near 523.

The fact that you've discovered a bug in your Market Watch window surprises me because the maximum number of Market Watch symbols in MT5 is 5000.

And as for 5000 I’m not so sure about that One.

After 1000 symbols it either stops, the Symbols don’t finish loading, The terminal gets buggy or it just crashes although rare. It usually just stops adding symbols.

I do speculate that adding symbols manually or with a script vs clicking on show all may behave differently in terms of how the symbols are loaded there.

 To be Honest I haven’t Really Been able to Pin Down The Exact Cause of The Error.

However I’ve noticed That once I create a custom Symbol. Sometimes it refuses to be removed from market watch window. Sometimes it can be removed normally but when it comes to that all symbols section there it’s persistent and cannot be removed, I had to go to the Terminals files and delete them manually.

As You can Imagine this became annoying fast as sometimes the custom symbol might not work if it was calculated incorrectly and I intended to iterate fast.

After messing around  I noticed that when I removed the symbols with a script they would be be removed as intended most of the 99% of the time.

Eventually realizing I might not be alone as some of the custom symbols that were persistent were not coded by me I decided to just make my solution public.

(Since the script works almost all the time , I decided not to rack my brain any further)

The only time that I'm not able to hide a symbol in the Market Watch window is while my corresponding custom chart generating EA is still running on the source chart. Just like standard symbols, the custom symbol can't be hidden while in use.

If I want to generate the custom chart anew from scratch, I also delete its symbol from the Symbols==>Specification list.

That’s the normal behaviour of MT5 , what happens here is a different from that. Even when you only have the marketplace open or completely nothing, they still won’t come off.

One day you will encounter it remember this script and you might come back knowing what causes it.

[O]nce I create a custom Symbol. Sometimes it refuses to be removed from market watch window.

I have to say that I've been using some forms of MetaTrader, offline charts, and/or custom charts since about 2011--and I've never experienced your issue with one custom chart nor more. I visit this Forum daily, and I haven't heard of your issue before.

I do know, however, that MT5 behaves differently depending on operating system and system resources--especially under a heavy load.

I see , it is quite rare and it’s something I’ve only recently encountered after 6 years of no problems.

System wise for my main machine I’m running windows 11 on an i7 13900k with 64 GB Ram dual channel and an RTX 3090 with two 1TB NVME SSD’s and a third 512 GB SSD. Then for secondary storage I have some SATA drives .

[Open Range BreakOut Indicator for MetaTrader 5](/en/code/65361)

The Open Range Breakout (ORB) indicator is a powerful technical analysis tool that identifies and tracks price breakouts from the opening range of trading sessions. This indicator is based on the concept that the high and low prices established during the first minutes of a trading session often serve as significant support and resistance levels throughout the remainder of the day.
The indicator automatically calculates the opening range based on user-defined time periods, plots multiple price targets, and provides visual and audio alerts for potential trading opportunities. It is designed to help traders identify high-probability breakout trades and retest scenarios.
