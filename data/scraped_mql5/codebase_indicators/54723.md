It's a good concept but there are still some essential candlestick patterns not there, and there are big problems when changing timeframe:

I made a fix for that issue

Thank you for fixing the error. I am going to replace my original code with yours and I'll put a big thank you at the top of the page.  
If you add also other candlestick patterns and you find it useful for others then your new code is welcome.
