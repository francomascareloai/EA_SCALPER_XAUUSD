Not all indicators are suitable to have an option to be applied to another indicator data via mt5 designed / allowed options. Linear regression line (original that uses "simple" prices posted here : [Linear Regression line](/en/code/50496)) is one that is suitable

We have regression channel as objects, but it needs to be constantly adjusted if we want it to follow new bars forming. Hence : here is the version that can be applied to another indicator(s)

PS: examples do not show it, but the color of lines changes depending on the slope of the regression line

I like the concept of this indicator, the line is not overbearing and it blends well with any indicator. It's interesting to use with lower periods to give more confidence for immediate term market direction

[ATR classic therefore without iATR by William210](/en/code/50548)

This code does not trace the iatr() because the iatr() or this code is a more modern version.
This code uses original smoothing, a kind of SMA and not wilder smoothing.
The analysis of the two smoothings can suggest opportunities elsewhere
