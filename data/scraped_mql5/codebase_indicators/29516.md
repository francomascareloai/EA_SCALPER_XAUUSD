Using this indicator you can specify your all drawing object to a specific symbol and timeframe.  
example if you draw any object ( Trendline/ Text/ Line / Anything ) on the GBPUSD H4 chart, it will only be restricted for the GBPUSD H4 chart. So it will not conflict with other charts/timeframe

unfortunately blankets all button and other indicators, removing them from certain charts/TFs, rather than just controlling objects, so does not work well

maybe could in future update specify which object to look at, ie trendlines, fibs, etc or add special comment to [object name](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object_property#enum_object_property_string "MQL5 documentation: Object Properties") to be considered
