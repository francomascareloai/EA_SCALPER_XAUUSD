This MQL4 indicator calculates and plots the **Rate of Change (ROC)** in two different ways:

**1. Percentage-Based ROC**:

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/159/4444395696466.png)

> This version expresses the price change as a percentage of the closing price **n periods ago**, making it useful for spotting momentum shifts across different symbols.

**2. ATR-Adjusted ROC**:

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/159/1383392724252.png)

  
​
> This variation normalizes the ROC by dividing it by the **Average True Range (ATR)** over the different period. It helps compare momentum across different assets by accounting for volatility differences.

The indicator allows traders to **visualize price momentum** with or without volatility adjustments, making it suitable for diverse trading strategies.

*Free and open-source.*

[Trade Assistant MT4](/en/code/55520)

Trade Assistant MetaTrader indicator — a multi-timeframe indicator that is based on three standard indicators: Stochastic oscillator, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and CCI (Commodity Channel Index). It displays current trend directions for M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, W1, and MN1 timeframes. When you follow such an indicator you have a clear picture of the trends across all important timeframes. It doesn't matter which timeframe you attach this indicator to. The indicator can be downloaded for MT4 and MT5.

[Total Power Indicator MT4](/en/code/55518)

Total Power Indicator (MetaTrader indicator) — is based on the two standard indicators — Bear Power and Bull Power. The indicator calculates how many bullish and bearish bars were there during a given look-back period and then calculates the proportional index for bears, bulls, and total (calculated as the absolute difference between bulls and bears) for the current bar. This way, we get continuous lines of the relative average bear and bull power over a period, removing the main disadvantage of the original Bear/Bull Power indicators — the lack of a long-term perspective. The original MetaTrader 4 version of Total Power Indicator was created by Daniel Fernandez of Asirikuy.com in 2011. The version for MT5 is now also available.
