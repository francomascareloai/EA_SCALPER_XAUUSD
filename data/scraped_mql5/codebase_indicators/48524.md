A simple observatory of individual currencies.

You can choose line color, line width and font size.

The daily start is by default 00:00, but you can change the hours and minutes from which to start the day.

If EUR is +1% and USD -0.50%, then the EURUSD cross is 1.50% (1-(-0.50%), and so are all the other crosses.

The indicator calculates on the closing price, at the first bar we already have the first price movement.
