The script exports the symbols from any \*.set file located at the "**MetaTrader 4 \experts\files\**" folder into the csv file ("**MetaTrader 4 \experts\files\SymbolList(ServerName).csv**"). The name of the \*.set file can be specified using the **SetFile\_name** external variable (you shouldn't specify the extention in the name).

  
  

The \*.set file itself can be obtained using the context menu command "Sets -> Save as" ("Market Watch" window). Then you should move the file from the "**MetaTrader 4\symbolsets\**" directory to "**MetaTrader 4 \experts\files\**" directory.

Hi!! nice script! But i have a problem. After i run the script, i go to open the file in the paths you provided,

i searched everywhere but i don't find the file, i think it doesn't work in my mt4 or are i'm not able to make scripts work. please help!

Moreover, i need (if possible :-) ) a similar program that generates a very simple file you can open with Excel,

containing a list of all the pairs with their daily open of today.

For example:

EURUSD 1.3658

GBPJPY 133.81

.......... .........

Many thanks if you can!!

P.s.: sorry for my English not correct!! :-)

The script swaps out all the symbols available in the Market Watch window into a csv file.

I've tested the EA on EUR/USD M15, it uses stochastic and RSI.
