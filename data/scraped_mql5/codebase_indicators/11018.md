Hey,

Thanks for this.

Do you know how I can modify the code to open up multiple symbols on multiple time frames?

I tried inserting additional *OpenChart* [functions](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions") after the one in the script using the same syntax, but it didn't work.

Any help would be great.

Thanks

You confuse where the next target? Use this indicator - it will show you where the next target.
