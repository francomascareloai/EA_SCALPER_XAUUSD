I was unable to run the indicator in [Strategy Tester](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/239 "Article \"The Fundamentals of Testing in MetaTrader 5\""). Could you tell me if the indicator repaints AFTER the candle close?

there is a price lag ,the price that comes in the alert is usually far from the actual price going on. So users gets delayed entry be it long or
short.

same way it usually tells user to close a losing position after a long time when new hourly candle is made, til that time sometimes user is already
in significant loss from previous entry, it should dyamically tell users in middle of an hourly candle to close the position if trend is
reversing isnt it?

Hi, so I just made a little code here that will help out a lot of coders that hate doing this (I count myself in it haha). It's made to calculate the lot size of a position based on the risk input and the account size+currency.
