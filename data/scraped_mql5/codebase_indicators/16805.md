The multitimeframe version of Donchian channel.

The Donchian channel is an indicator used in market trading developed by
Richard Donchian. It is formed by taking the highest high and the
lowest low of the last *n* periods. The area between the high and the low
is the channel for the period chosen.

The deviation from the
classical highest high/lowest low channel is that Donchian channel is
shifted by one period. That shift allows it to have signals (when either
the upper or the lower band is broken by the close price it is
considered to be a signal for long or short).
