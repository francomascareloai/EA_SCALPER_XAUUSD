This script can close all your open positions in your MetaTrader 4 terminal, or you can select different similar positions.

You can select:

* by position side: Long or Short;
* by magic number: close or skip all position with specified magic number;
* by Market Instrument;
* and the combination of the above options.

You just need to drag the script to the chart and adjust the settings.
