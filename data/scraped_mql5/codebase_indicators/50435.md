### 

This indicator calculates an Adaptive RSI using tick data and plots it along with fast and slow moving averages in a separate window. It provides options to customize the calculation periods, moving average types, and visual settings.

It was a conversion from an ancient 2008 MT4 indicator made by Rosh at trend laboratory, but at the time, a different RSI indicator was loaded.

This time it will load the default RSI indicator that comes with the installation of MT5.

You can say that it "transforms" the RSI with a slow and fast moving average based on tick calculations.

Here is a comparison with the default RSI that comes with MT5, and the RSI adaptive:

[![RSI compare](https://c.mql5.com/18/155/TickRSI_adaptive_compare__1.JPG "RSI compare")](https://c.mql5.com/18/155/TickRSI_adaptive_compare.JPG "https://c.mql5.com/18/155/TickRSI_adaptive_compare.JPG")

The green plot is the tick price plot, the blue plot is the fast RSI line, the red plot is the slow RSI line.

 not works

1. You have to use it when the market is open (when there are live ticks)

2. You have to wait for the initial calculations to complete and when the tick count is high enough for these calculations (tick indicators often take time before they plot)

3. You have to use it on the M1 timeframe

Will not work in an inactive market with low liquidity and very little price action.

I checked again to make sure, and I see it is working fine.

I will upload an optimized code, even though it doesn't speed it up in any way.
