This indicator creates the following trade server disconnect alerts in MT5:

* Pop-ups,
* Sounds,
* Push notifications (TextAlerts),
* Email,
* Printing to Experts tab\*, and
* Chart label text.

\* If you enable ExpertsTab with another alert that automatically prints to the Experts tab in MT5, then you will get somewhat duplicate data printed there.

[Adaptive CCI](/en/code/62155)

Adaptive CCI - Commodity Channel Index with dynamically adjusting upper and lower limits based on market volatility. Eliminates fixed thresholds (like 100/-100) by using EMA-smoothed peaks and troughs, providing more reliable overbought/oversold signals tailored to each asset's current volatility. Perfect for identifying high-probability reversal points with adaptive confirmation levels.
