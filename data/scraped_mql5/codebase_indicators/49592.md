Не каждый день заканчивается в 23:59
Ваше решение не верное.

New here, Need a clarification. It takes system time right? not the trading end of the day zone.

Assume Trading works in GMT, but system time is [different time zone](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1208 "Article: Liquid Chart "), it won't stop at wrong time?

   *TimeCurrent* is chart time. There is no asumption.
2. ```mql5
      datetime dCurrentTime = TimeCurrent();
      datetime time_tradeend = StrToTime(TimeToStr(TimeCurrent(),TIME_DATE) + " "  + "23:59");
      return dCurrentTime>=time_tradeend;
   ```

   However, unless you get a tick in the last minute of the day, the code fails.
3. Don't use strings, just do the numerical calculation.

   ```mql5
   static datetime curDate=0; datetime preDate=curDate; curDate=date();
   bool isNewDay = curDate != prevDate;
   ⋮
   ```

**Biswarup Banerjee [#](/en/forum/466609#comment_53270785):**  
 why do you say it is wrong? what part seems wrong to you?

You assume that ALL Fx brokers end their trading day at 23:59, which is not true.

The Fx day actually ends on 23:59 only on GMT+2 brokers. Other brokers have different times, for example exness ends on 20:59.

then I think it would be better if we take the end time as input.
