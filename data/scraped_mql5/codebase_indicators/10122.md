As usual, you have to put it into experts/scripts metatrader subfolder and restart mt4 eventually  
(or just compile it if you are able to). You don't need to download anything but the script itself.

* username
* password
* message (eventually leave blank to skip posting to twitter and just upload the chart screenshot)
* width of the screenshot
* height of the screenshot

This script embeds a stripped version of [my HTTP library for mt](/en/code/10121)

(note that you **don't** have to download the library as is embedded in the twitpic script)

Well sadly I just couldn't get this to work.. using mt4 and win xp.. It does put the screenshot into the file folder but doesn't transfer to twitpic.. I reloaded a new winit file but still no work.. To bad this did look like a good idea. With 300+ downloads somebody must have gotten it to work..
