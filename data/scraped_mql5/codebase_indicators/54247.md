It is an indicator that determines target levels according to the average of price movements on an annual, monthly, weekly or 4-hourly basis.

The current levels are determined as follows;

OpenBuffer[i] = PeriodOpenPrice;

HighBuffer[i] = PeriodOpenPrice + adr/2;

LowBuffer[i] = PeriodOpenPrice - adr/2;

MaxHighBuffer[i] = PeriodOpenPrice + adr;

MinLowBuffer[i] = PeriodOpenPrice - adr;

[Multi\_Divergence\_EA](/en/code/62742)

The EA identifies trade setups by waiting for a user-defined number of indicators (e.g., 2 out of 3) to show divergence simultaneously. This multi-layer confirmation approach filters out market noise.
Key Features:
Triple Confirmation Engine: Analyzes RSI, MACD, & Stochastic divergence.
Advanced Filters: Optional Trend Filter (MA) and Volume Filter for superior signal quality.
Full Customization: Control all indicator settings, divergence sensitivity, and trade logic.
Professional Risk Management: Use fixed lots or percentage-based money management with SL/TP.
