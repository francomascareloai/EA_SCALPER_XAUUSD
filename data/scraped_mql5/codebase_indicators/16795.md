The problem that people overlook when asking to calculate an angle of
an average is simple: data on Y axes of a time series chart is
different type from the data on X axis. Since they are completely
different, the angle can not be calculated from that data. Unless you
make them the compatible. Here is one possible solution: this version "converts" time into
"pips" by using average true range as a value of a single time bar and
that way unifies the values of X and Y axis. Using the ATR for that is
an approximation (there is no 100% accurate method to do that), but it
is not a bad approximation: at least it is not showing results of >
90 degrees.

This indicator uses calculation method described above and extended to be able to calculate the rest of the 18 types of averages. So that all the usual types are covered with this version.

Hi mladen,

Could release a version like of angle of averages as "histogram BAR"  (view like Detrended Histogram that you made...)

tks

Hey Mladen, can you tell me what length are you using for the ATR? Is it dynamically the same length as the [moving average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "MetaTrader 5 Help: Moving Average indicator")? same length as the "bars for angle"? or a set length of 14, 20, etc?
