# MQL5 Source Codes of Libraries for MetaTrader 5 - 9

![icon](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/code-icon.png)

Libraries are small sub-programs containing a certain functionality that can then be used for developing new applications. Once written and thoroughly checked, a library allows users to speed up the development of new MQL5 applications. One of the illustrative examples is ALGLIB library containing multiple numerical analysis functions.

Library source codes can be downloaded and used in MetaEditor when developing trading strategies. They cannot be launched in MetaTrader 5 independently.
