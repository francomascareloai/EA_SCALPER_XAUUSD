**INTRODUCTION :**

The breakout strength meter is a trading tool that is used to identify which currencies are the strongest to breakout, and which currencies are the weakest to breakout.

Don't hesitate to send all your comments and I would appreciate rating this trading tool.

**HOW TO USE IT :**

* define and see how a breakout strength meter works.
* use this trading tool to confirm real and fake breakouts (the most important part)
* compile the script in MT4 or MT5.

You can also check the following video. It is about Currency Strength Meter

**megghegg:**  
Rodi, I have compiled and loaded your tool so that I can give it a try. The first thing I notice is that the tool is floating over my charts, so that some parts of some of the charts are obscured. Is there a way to dock it at the side or bottom of the window? Also, the manimum size of the floating tool is pretty big. Regardless, it looks like a great tool - thanks for sharing!

Hi [@megghegg](/en/users/megghegg) thanks for showing interest in this trading tool

concerning your question, I urge to watch the tutorial that I've shared in the description of this tool.

Once you run the trading tool for the first time, you should know that when it opens a new chart, it tries to get the data. When the charts are obscured, it means it didn't find any data yet and it is trying to download these data; so it might take some time.

So, I suggest to rerun the script more than once at the beginning to download all the historical data of all the charts.

Keep up the good work

As you can verify from the publication and comments, the author's user account was deleted, and so was the video source.

In other words, there is no support. You will have to study the source code and figure out how it works and how to use it.

You are welcome, but please note that in many cultures, one does not use informal language when writing to people one does not know. Please don't use expressions like “buddy”, “brother” or others, which are too informal.
