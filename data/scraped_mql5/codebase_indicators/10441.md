### Description:

The script runs in background and writes the distance of pips from horizontal lines on the chart to the current market price.

You can drag lines to see the distance.

**WHRoeder:**  
The stated purpose is to display the "distance in pips" But what it does is display the distance in **points**. A pip is NOT a point on 5 digit brokers.

  
For 5 digit account it displays Fractional pips distance. I think this script should show it. No reason to hide

```mql5
cala Pip 10 points if you say 1/100000 is not a pip, just a multiple of 10
```

Can you please modify the location of the distance value to a bit right so that when the price goes up/down from the line ,we still can see the figure.

Hi Landofcash I'm a newbie who is looking for something along these lines--would prefer something to calculate pip value to $ value however this looks great. My provider is a 5 digit broker however i don't trade in micros, does this script still calculate the 4th digit.

As i,m a newbie do I pay you to download the script, obviously happy to do so or if you have a script to calculate pip $ value even better

Kindest Regards

Monty

Often times I find my chart is too cluttered with indicators to see the price action, however I still need those reference points. My solution was to create an indicator which displays the current level of some of the MA's of the current candle.
