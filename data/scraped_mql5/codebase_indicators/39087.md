This simple, quick & dirty script code will output a CSV file of all the Signals' properties as reported by the [MQL4 Trade Signals](https://docs.mql4.com/signals "https://docs.mql4.com/signals") functionality. With the resulting CSV file opened as a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel), you can sort them by your preferred metrics and choose that suite your requirements for copy trading.

Please note that the [MQL4 Trade Signals](https://docs.mql4.com/signals "https://docs.mql4.com/signals") functionality, only lists MT4 signals. See also [Listing all MT5 Signals' properties to a CSV file](/en/code/39071) for *MetaTrader 5*. It also seems to be limited to a maximum of 1000 signals (I don't know how many there are in total).

Before running the *script*, open up the "Signals" tab, and make sure that terminal downloads data for signals. Otherwise the *script* will have no data to report on.

The CSV file will be output to terminal's "**MQL4\Files**" folder. In *MetaTrader* go to the menu *File* → *Open Data Folder*, then navigate to the "**MQL4\Files**" folder.

Please note, that all my *CodeBase* publications' source code are now also available in "Public Projects" tab of *MetaEditor* under the name "FMIC".

**Victoryy Yow [#](/en/forum/401224#comment_40469163):** Hi Fernando, Thank you very much for your prompt reply. Yes, I did noticed that 4 lines appeared at the logs. But I cannot find anything in the "MQL4\Files" folder. I attached also print screen of this. Please help and many thanks.

Your screenshot is too small. I can't read anything on it.

Before running the *script*, open up the "Signals" tab, and make sure that terminal downloads data for signals. Otherwise the *script* will have no data to report on.

If after this, the situation is still not resolved, show the following:

1. Screenshot of parameter settings you used.
2. Screenshot of "Experts" log
3. Screenshot of "Journal" log
4. Make sure all the screenshot are readable.

Hi Fernando, I found some problems in my signals data download now. I'll have to solve this problem first. Will get back to you when needed. Cheers.

Run it on a live chart, not in the *Strategy Tester* and before running the *script*, open up the "Signals" tab, and make sure that terminal downloads data for signals. Otherwise the *script* will have no data to report on.

If after this, the situation is still not resolved, show the following:

1. Screenshot of parameter settings you used.
2. Screenshot of "Experts" log
3. Screenshot of "Journal" log
4. Make sure all the screenshot are readable.

**NB!Please discuss this issue here and not in private.**

In response to the screenshots you sent to me in private, I can see that from your "Experts Log" that an error "Invalid file handle!" is being reported. This means that the file creation is being denied. Either the file permissions on the folder are incorrect or the file already existes and is locked. Try also using a different file name.

So, please show a screenshot of the "MQL4\Files" folder which clearly shows its content as well as the full path name of the directory.

Also show a screenshot of the MT4 build number and release date.
