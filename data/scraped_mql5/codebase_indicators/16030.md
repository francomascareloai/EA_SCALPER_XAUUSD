The indicator is the development of the idea of using the [Normalized Volume](/en/code/8156).

First, the normalized volume values are now expressed as a percentage of the average value for the period. Consequently, the data on the chart can now take negative values, which means a lull in the market.

Another useful addition is coloring of the histogram columns depending on the value of the normalized volume.

* Gray color means that the current volume is less than the average for the period;
* Blue color means a small excess of the volume compared to the average for the period;
* Brown color means that the increase in volume has exceeded the 38,2% Fibo level compared to the average for the period;
* Red color means that the increase in volume has exceeded the 61,8% Fibo level compared to the average for the period;
* Yellow color (red in the figure below, so as not to blend with the background) means that the increase in volume has exceeded the 100% level compared to the average for the period.

Originally this indicator has been written in MQL4 and was first published in the [Code Base](/en/code/8208) on 19.06.2008.
