# Conclusion

This section concludes the book. Throughout seven parts and numerous chapters, we have explored various aspects of MQL5 programming, starting from the language basics and advancing to related sophisticated technologies that enable a gradual transition from creating individual trader-specific tools to complex trading systems and products.

The knowledge you gain will assist you in bringing various ideas to life and achieving success in the world of professional algorithmic trading.

* Develop applications and sell them through the [Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market), the largest store of programs for MetaTrader with a ready infrastructure for authors. The Market provides access to a huge audience, offering product protection and licensing along with an integrated system for accepting payments.
* Develop custom applications via [Freelance](https://www.mql5.com/en/job). Access the entire array of development orders and benefit from a convenient working system and payment protection.
* Share your experience by publishing your code in the [Code Base](https://www.mql5.com/en/code). Present your programs to thousands of traders from the MQL5.community.

And, of course, keep learning. The [www.mql5.com](https://www.mql5.com/) website features a wealth of information and ready-made algorithms:

* [Programming articles](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles), in which professional authors address practical problems.
* [Forum](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum) where you can exchange experiences and seek advice from other developers.
* [Code Base](https://www.mql5.com/en/code) with program source codes to aid in learning the capabilities of the MQL5 languages and creating your own programs.

Finally, I would like to remind you that software development involves not only programming but also many other equally important areas: writing technical specifications (even if only for yourself), designing, prototyping, creating user interface design, providing documentation, and further support. All these aspects significantly influence the efficiency of your work as a programmer and the quality of the final result.

In particular, most practical tasks can be broken down into standard algorithms and principles that different language programmers have been using for a long time. This includes design patterns, collections of data structures optimized for specific tasks, and tools for automating development. All of this should be applied in the MetaTrader 5 platform with the help of MQL5 and in addition to it. While the book is just the first step on the path to professional growth.
