The EA buys at green AO and AC, sells at red AO and AC. The market exit is performed when any of the indicators changes its color.

It is recommended to use the indicator on the H4 timeframe.

**Input Parameters:**

* **Number of lots** — number of order lots.
* **Order's comment** — order comment.
* **Magic Number** — EA's magic number.

Due to the simplicity of the algorithm the EA does not require complicated settings. The automatic lot calculation depending on the deposit can also be implemented.

**Max:**  

thanks for posting!

...looks like it is buy when AC crosses 0 rather than Green? is that right or can you confirm order triggers? thanks

This EA used AC and AO indicators both. If AC and AO have the same color - than order is opened. In version 1.1 also taken into account sign of indicators. In previous version sign is not taken.

Best regards,

Pavel Voronov

Hi Pavel,

I noticed that both AC & AO can repaint (1 or 2 bars back) in smaller timeframes. How about the suggested H4 in live circumstances because in strategytester it repaints on that timeframe as well? Thanks.

Hello! This EA uses only formed values of AO and AC. That's why EA is not depended on current value of AO and AC, and repainting of indicator is not influence for strategy.

Hello Pavel, sorry to ask again and thanks for using English...

for [Buy order](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_book_type "MQL5 documentation: Trade Orders in Depth Of Market") AC must be >0 and green, but AO just green? I don't think sign of AO is needed, as AO slower than AC.

It is simple but useful EA!

I'am sorry for my bad English :)

Yes, for Buy order AO and AC must be more than 0 and green, and vice versa for sell order.

I think, that using only color of AO is very interesting idea, I will research this algorithm in near future.
