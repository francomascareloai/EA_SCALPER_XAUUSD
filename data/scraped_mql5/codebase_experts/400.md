The indicator is a moving average based on the [EMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/ru/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma) algorithm and adapted to a financial instrument current volatility.

The indicator consists of two averages - fast MAMA (green line) and slow FAMA (red line). Crossover of the averages provide signals for market entries and exits.

Two variants of the indicator are presented here: MAMA.mq5 and MAMA\_Optim.mq5. Their only difference is that the second one is more optimized for computer resources saving and more preferable for using in Expert Advisors, while the first one has more clear code.

**GODZILLA:**  
 It seems that the source code didn't take into account the possibility of an error when dividing by zero! I had to cut the code and sew the missing elements! Wait for the files to be updated!

Thank you very much, and thanks again for all your codes as well.

**Flabby [#](/en/forum/4378#comment_42748147):** Can I use this with metatrader 4?

No, it's for MT5/MQL5. Search the codebase for a MT4/MQL4 version.
