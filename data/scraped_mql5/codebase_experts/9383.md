### Description:

This indicator will create a Fibonacci Retracement Object on your chart, and auto-update its values.

You can indicate if you prefer to use the classic High/Low values, or the less classic Open/Close ones (price\_type: 0 = High/Low, 1 = Open/Close).

You can also define how many bars to look back maximum (Band\_period).

Is band\_period the same as number\_of\_bars?

Hello Author,

a idea, can you a create this Fib, with an entry Point by a mouseclick. After this, the fib shows the entrypoint automatically to the low, in the result: you have your best fib level, that you search.

thanks

Balduin
