The Exp\_JBrainTrend1Stop\_ReOpen trading system is based on the [JBrainTrend1Stop](/en/code/758) indicator color change with adding to trend-following positions. A trade signal forms at a bar closing if the indicator color changes. Its volume is then further increased if profit in points increases a threshold fixed in the EA inputs.

The data on addings are stored in a string comment to a position in the following format: *number of addings/last trade price/last trade volume*.

Place JMA.ex5 and JBrainTrend1Stop.ex5 compiled files to the <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
