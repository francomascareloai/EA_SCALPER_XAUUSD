Additionally, it will calculate the total number trades, the total number of lots, and the distance to the breakeven line in points and profit/loss. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

You can press the  Shift + B  keyboard shortcut to hide or show the breakeven line. The indicator supports multiple input parameters to configure the calculations and the looks.

* **line\_color\_buy** (default = clrTeal) — the color for the breakeven line when the total cumulative position is long.
* **line\_color\_sell** (default = clrPink) — the color for the breakeven line when the total cumulative position is short.
* **line\_color\_neutral** (default = clrSlateGray) — the color for the breakeven line when the total cumulative position is neutral.
* **line\_style** (default = STYLE\_SOLID) — the breakeven line style.
* **line\_width** (default = 1) — the breakeven line width.
