This is meant to be an aggregating service script that collects data from the EconomicCalendar functions & outputs the values to a text file as a list of dictionaries for each event collected over a period of time.

This is meant to be a prototype test to approaching the solution, temporary for users of the PythonAPI, offering access to the same data.

All variables are current statically declared.

Have they made the PythonAPI yet? Its 2025 now.  
  
btw thank you teddy for this script. I have been able to modify it to write the data in JSON in a scructured format.
