BrainTrend1 is a market direction indicator.

It indicates trend directions in colors. When a price changes or stays in an up-trend, the candlesticks are colored in blue. When a price changes or stands in a downtrend, the candlesticks are colored in red. In case a price changes its direction or a trend is unstable, the candlesticks are not colored.

BrainTrend1 can be used at any timeframe. Its algorithm is based on the [ATR](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/atr) and [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so) indicators. In this version the values of all algorithm variables are designed as the indicator's input parameters, so now it be used with custom settings.
