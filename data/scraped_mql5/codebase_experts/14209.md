* Based On : RSI , CCI , BB
* Time Frame : 1 HR
* Logic : If RSI CCI down with BB then sell, otherwise buy or wait
* Other Options:
* Selection of buy/sell
* Trading time selection
* Auto lot control
* One position at a time.

**Recommendations:**

* Remember, in any case of loss I am not responsible.
* I recommend to set **Auto Lot Option** to false because of increase in lots.
* First test on **demo account.**
* **Please teach if you want to teach me. Thank you with respect.**

I am completely new. Can I set this up so it will never sell at a loss? Also how do I get it to start autotrading? I have autotrading set in MT4. Thanks for any help.

[Indicator Buffers](/en/code/15598)

This EA will detect the buffers values of any indicator you want. Just type its name in the EA settings.

[Reco system](/en/code/15447)

It is a recovery system implemented in EA. But you can copy it to any other EAs.
