 Hi, Daniel. How do I get the script for opening multiple trades etc

Download the script file.

Open your Mt4/mt5 folder and past the script in the script folder. It will be seen on metatrader after refresh.

Then you can just run it by clicking on it.

Hi Daniel.

Over the past few days, I have accidentally found Multi SellLimitOrders & Multi SellStopOrders as well as Multi\_BuyLimitOrders & Multi\_BuyStopOrders. I am very happy to have found the scripts I need.

However, I still do not know how to [place pending orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_trade_request_actions "MQL5 documentation: Trade Operation Types") at the exact price of my choice.

Please let me know.

Thank you.

Viet.

Hello Em,  
First, the script file must been at the script folder in the mt4/mt5 platform.  
Double click on the pending order type, Say SellLimit and a dialogue box will appear for you to input your orders.  
  
If you want a target price, change the from NumofPips to target and use the targetPrice to set your precise price.  
  
If you want pips, then use the NumofPips and Pips\_4rm Ask\_Price to set the pips distance. then click ok.   
You can watch the video below to get better understanding. Thank you .

[Multi SellOrders](/en/code/44026)

To assist traders who wish to open multiple sell orders quickly, a script file has been developed that allows them to execute a large number of trades with just one command. The default take profit and stop loss values are set in 5-digit broker format, but for traders using a 4-digit broker, the default must be TP=40 and SL=20.
Num\_of\_Sell is the number of trades to execute. This script file can be extremely useful for traders who want to take advantage of market conditions quickly and efficiently. By simplifying the process of opening multiple sell orders, it can save traders valuable time and allow them to focus on other aspects of their trading

[Multi SellLimitOrders & Multi SellStopOrders](/en/code/44039)

Multi Selllimit and Sellstop orders are script files that enable traders to place multiple orders with ease. These orders allow traders to enter the market at a specific price level, or at a specified number of pips away from the current market price, with stop-loss and take-profit levels. By default, the pips value is set to 400, which means the trade will be placed 400 pips away from the current market price for a 5-digit broker. Moreover, the multi Selllimit and Sellstop orders offer traders the flexibility to customize their trading strategies. Traders can set the stop-loss level to zero if they do not use stop-loss, and can choose between a target price or a pip-based entry. This level of flexibility allows traders to tailor their trading strategies to their specific needs, which can result in better trading outcomes.
