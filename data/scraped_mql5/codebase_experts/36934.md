Since in the original (published here [Moving Average Bands](/en/code/36925)) it is not as obvious how the indicator can be used, here is a version that is extended with one of the possible ways (that relies of the bands values) how the indicator can be used for trading signals

**Recommendations:**

* You can use color changes for entries, re-entries and possible exits

Thank you for publishing this version!   
I spent about an hour last night trying to understand the signals in the original version but couldn't come to a clear conclusion!

PS; The only flaw of the indicator is that unfortunately it does not work well in flat markets.
