This strategy is based on some very interesting enter criterias and usefull funtcions are included which I used to create this trading bot. It has shown very good potential in the markets lately, but some changes have to be made in order to test it with a demo account/real money. The backtest is with 30 Leverage.

There are 4 inputs:

* Tp : Take Profit: the multiplier of the total money invested, for example if you invested 1000 dollars and the tp is 0.05, the ea will close when the trades reach 50 dollar profit.
* Multiplier: This is the volume multiplier in the grid.
* MaPeriod: The period of the moving average in the bollinger bands

The StopLoss is 10 times the takeprofit.

Hope I could help.

Hi Peter,

good idea but looks not as promising in backtesting (M5 EURUSD, this year until now)

[![](https://c.mql5.com/3/413/4759797102060__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/3/413/4759797102060.png "https://c.mql5.com/3/413/4759797102060.png")

What do think. Maybe I took the wrong parameters...?

  Wrong timeframe.

You mention your "AdvantEdge" [product](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/fundamental/economic_indicators_usa/usa_productivity "Productivity"), but it's not listed on your profile anywhere

![KA-Gold Bot](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[KA-Gold Bot](/en/code/45323)

KA-Gold Bot is an advanced trading advisor specifically designed for gold, utilizing the powerful combination of the Keltner channel strategy and two exponential moving averages (EMAs) - the 10-period EMA and the 200-period EMA.
Principle of Operation: The 10-period EMA represents the average price cutting above/below the Keltner band, confirming an uptrend/downtrend. The price being above the 200-period EMA supports the uptrend/downtrend. This indicates that the uptrend/downtrend has been stronger than the previous 10 periods, considering the volatility over the last 50 periods.

[Simple check open orders filter boolean function for Expert Advisors](/en/code/44892)

This is a simple boolean function for the EA to detect if there is any previous open market orders without using the "OrdersTotal()" built-in function which might cause the EA to calculate positions not opened by each specific magicnumber provided by the EA.
