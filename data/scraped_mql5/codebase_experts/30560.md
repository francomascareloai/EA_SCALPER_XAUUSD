### **OVERVIEW**

   Taking the close price of a certain hour of a certain day of the week as a reference, if a user-specified percentage of the daily average price range is exceeded from this level, expert opens buy for upside movement or sell for downside movement. take-profit and stop-loss levels are determined by user-defined percentages of this range.

### **MARTINGALE MONEY MANAGEMENT**

   Probably, you all know martingale strategy which you've doubled volume for each loss. It is a very risky strategy unless you don't know how much you will consecutively lose. Besides, as long as you know how many steps you can lose at most, it is the fastest way to compensate your losses. In this expert, previous cumulative losses are also taken into account, and the losses are covered in the shortest way by adding them to the take-profit and stop loss levels of the next transaction.

Hi, Thanks for this awesome EA. I wanted some help with the coding. I'm facing Unsupported filling mode issue, the following is a error message:

2020.09.06 18:43:08.294 2020.08.31 10:47:12   failed market buy 0.1 GBPUSDmicro sl: 1.30642 tp: 1.33096 [Unsupported filling mode]

2020.09.06 18:43:08.294 2020.08.31 10:47:12   Alert: ERROR: buy order cannot be opened.

(As EA tried only buying, so I don't have error message for that.)

Following is a screenshot of the same:

Note: Code remains unchanged. I'm using the following Processor configuration, screenshot:
