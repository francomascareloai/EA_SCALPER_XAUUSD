The purpose of this indicator is to demonstrate newbie friendly way a structure of a multi time frame indicator based on recursion.

A function which is responsible of the indicator calculation itself can be replaced easily.

A functionality which is responsible of downloading of multi time frame data can also be utilized and if modified correctly,

creating of multi symbol implementations are possible as well.

2024.02.06:  A bug fix in synchronization of upper time frame values.   
                    In addition, the indicator uses close values of previous bars now. It is a practical way to avoid the price fluctuations of the current bar.

Few improvements from standart fractal:
1. You can chouse size of fractal. Standart version use 2 as constant
2. It does not draw fractals against the trend, which makes your chart much more informative
