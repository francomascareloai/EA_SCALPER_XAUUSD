The Exp\_Bezier\_ReOpen trading system is based on the [Bezier](/en/code/774) indicator color change with adding to trend-following positions. A trade signal forms at a bar closing if the indicator line color changes. Its volume is then further increased if profit in points increases a threshold fixed in the EA inputs.

The data on addings are stored in a string comment to a position in the following format: *number of addings/last trade price/last trade volume*.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file Bezier.ex5 in order to run. Place it to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
