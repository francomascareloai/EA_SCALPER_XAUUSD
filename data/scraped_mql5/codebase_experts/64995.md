There's a frustrating limitation with the Indicator strategy tester option as it enables a visual backtest simulation for one indicator only.

The solution is to build a system for loading indicators and use the expert advisor strategy tester option with visual mode selected.

This system allows you to test up to four indicators at the same time, and the point is to see how one indicator might weigh up against another indicator in the strategy, and to visually see how the strategy is performing.

Four indicators that are native to the software are used as default inputs, and the software automatically understands these paths. You can test your own custom indicators, and also use custom paths.

This way you can't customize your indicators. It's easier and more efficient to prepare and setup all needed indicators on an online chart and save the template as *tester.tpl* or *your\_expert\_name.tpl*. Then you can run test for *any expert* or *your\_expert\_name* as usual and corresponding template with indicators will be loaded automatically.

Are you saying that multiple indicators can run within a strategy tester using templates?

For a live chart, I understand that templates are more efficient, but I don't know of any other way to use multiple indicators consecutively in the visual strategy tester. I had no interest in coding a custom replay system as I wanted the speed dial from the visual tester environment.

If it works, it's hard to know if it's more efficient as you would have to save/rewrite the template many times if you wanted to change settings. In this way you can save your indicators with the best defaults, and then easily switch indicator names/paths.
