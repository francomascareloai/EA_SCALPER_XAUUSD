### Description:

To draw all levels, it is necessary to download the history.

In the second version the High and Low values are plotted with different colors. V2 also allows to use High/Low values for the defined number of months (N).

**Editor's comment**:

It seems that there was translation error (JS.Levels.V2.mq4), it has been corrected.

The variable "Month" has been changed to "Months", so now it works.

Please download again. Thank you.

Great indicator, just what I have been looking for in a very long time. Rated 9/10

When the indicator is [removed](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/integration/python_metatrader5/mt5copyratesfrom_py "MQL5 Documentation: copy_rates_from function") from a chart some lines are still visible, it seems that not all objects it placed are deleted.

I changed the colour to represent high = red and low = blue for my charts.

Thanks.

9/10  
Could you please add the Date from the past to each line :)  
Also, please add object delete for the resistance, just to complete your great indicator.  
Bravo!
