[Identify the Potential Best Days To Trade (Improve your Strategy) - MT4](/en/code/31465)

This is one of the important thing to consider in order to improve our strategy by calculating on average how much an asset moves, in which it will allow us to identify the best days to trade when the market moves the most as well as the worst days to trade in order to prevent trading during these days.

[ECN Trade Modifier](/en/code/31509)

On all MT4 market execution accounts (ECN, ECN Zero and Pro), preset stoploss/takeprofit price levels are not permitted.
If a client wishes to specify stoploss/takeprofit values for an order, the client must modify the existing position after the order is opened.
This EA helps a client effortlessly ensure that an on order is modified to desired stoploss/takeprofit values a short while after a trade position is opened
This is especially helpful for scalpers who want to avoid the trouble of manually editing trade properties every-time a position is taken on a financial instrument.
