[Range Oscillator](/en/code/20849 "Range Oscillator - indicator for MetaTrader 5") is a useful indicator, but in its original form it probably lacks some smoothness in order to avoid some false signals.

This version is adding that (smoothing) option in order to avoid some false signals.

In order to filter out some of the signals of the Price Zone Oscillator - Floating Levels indicator, smoothing is added to this version.

![Range Oscillator + Bands (Smoothed)](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Range Oscillator + Bands (Smoothed)](/en/code/21635)

This version is the smoothed version of the original Range Oscillator + Bands indicator. Smoothing is cleaning up some false signals and, since the smoothing method is JMA (which has very small lag) the added lag is as small as it can be making it much easier to use in a lot of decision situations.
