Hello.

Thank you for all your comments in mp.

Know that I intend to do many of these simple codes.

They can be used as a tutorial for the youngest or as a starting code for the most experienced.

Be aware that I created a free PDF file with many more code explanations.

Get in touch in mp and I give you the link
