The Expert Advisor uses three iMAs (Moving Average, MA), one iOsMA (Moving Average of Oscillator and one iRVI (Relative Vigor Index, RVI). The EA can use either a fixed lot or a lot calculated as a risk percent of free margin. It can apply Trailing Stop based on the High/Low of earlier bars. It only works on a new bar, i.e. at the moment of formation of a new bar.
