The Exp\_HLRSign Expert Advisor is based on signals generated by the [HLRSign](/en/code/12572) semaphore arrow signal indicator.

The signal is formed when a bar is closing if the indicator has crossed the overbought or oversold level determined by the values of the Expert Advisor input parameters:

```mql5
input uint HLR_UpLevel=80;      // Overbought level
input uint HLR_DnLevel=20;      // Oversold level
```

There are two algorithms for deals available in the Expert Advisor input parameters:

```mql5
input Alg_Method Mode=MODE_OUT; // Breakthrough algorithm
```

1. Make deals when entering the oversold or overbought zones;
2. Make deals when exiting the oversold or overbought zones;

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file HLRSign.ex5 in order to run. Place it to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
