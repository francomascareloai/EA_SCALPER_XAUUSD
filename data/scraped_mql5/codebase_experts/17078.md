The name of the indicator might be a bit misleading. Holt's double exponential smoothing is mostly used for forecasting, not as an average. The forecasting method usually used with it is a sort of linear forecasting.

- Double Exponential Smoothing     
  

Like the
regression forecast, the double exponential smoothing forecast is based
on the assumption of a model consisting of a constant plus a linear
trend.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/55/hol_1.gif)

For the purposes of a forecast where the parameters of the
model may change, it is more convenient to express the model as a
function of , where is the positive displacement from a reference time
T.

To make it usable in both manners though (as an average or as an "average" with forecasting), setting the number of forecasted bars to <= 0, turns the forecasting part off.

As
usual with the forecasting parts, it is strongly advised not to use it in signaling mode. The
forecasting part is a subject of change and should be used only as an
estimation of trend component of the double smoothing, not as signal.
Alerts in this indicator are not alerting on the change of the forecast
part, but on the change of the "past" part - which is not going to
change with time past.
