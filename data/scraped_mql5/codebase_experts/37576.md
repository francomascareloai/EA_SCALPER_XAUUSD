This EA check the close of last 5 candles to determine the trend and then places a buy trade.

SL and TP can be set in the input.

It doesn't make any sense. Why would such a code be needed?

It basically identifies the market trend based on last few bars, and then tries to place the trade based on the trend.

So you are assuming that 5 candles in one direction proves a strong enough trend that it will continue? Like trading is that easy.

Where's the proof in a [backtest](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks ")? This is the the latest in a string of completely useless codes. Have you ever actually traded?

Thank you for your feedback. Will work further to improve this logic and post updated version in future when I have a better strategy.

Do you have a demonstration video you can send me.

I like the idea very much, I am assuming that it detects trending both ways up and down.

Can wait to hear back from you very soon.
