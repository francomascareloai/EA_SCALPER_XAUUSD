This EA compare last 2 days High and Low values in order to find a breakout on the current day. It place a pending order on the High of yesterday (if H/L of yesterday is higher than H/L of the day before) or on the Low of yesterday (if H/L of yesterday is lower than H/L of the day before).

If order is not triggered on the end of day it will canceled.

It works well only on currencies against JPY: **USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY.**

Works with only open prices but I suggest to test it in control points mode or every tick and on **D1** timeframe because the trigger for the order (after successfull breakout condition) refers to ASK/BID prices.

No parameters to be optimized: this is a clear sign of robustness of the system that, in every way, need to be optimized in order to get more smoothed equities.

I will be very happy if you can share with me some good ideas to improve performance of the system!

SL and TP prices are calculated from range of previous day. Using a fixed value for a strategy like this is not only self-defeating but also illogic, in my opinion. I think that is always better make it "dynamic" instead of using fixed value that need to be optimized and can work well only in specific period and maybe not for the next day. A lot of people love systems with fixed SL and TP and waste a lot of time overfitting those.

I prefer a more dynamic approach, always based on market condition. ATR based SL can be another good thing but for this strategy I think that is better refers to day the triggers the breakout.

Hi Fabio,

Very good concept, it is better than many EAs in the markets place !

I changed time frame to Hour, then it produced 400% for 1 year.

Please put [money management](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/4162 "Article: Money Management by Vince. Implementation as a MQL5 Wizard Module") and add some feature like 'trailing stop' as I can see many orders go correct direction and show many pips in profit, but after 2-3 days the order didn't close and it reached return point, then it end up with lose.

Thanks for your good feedback!

I always suggest to people to not use a trailing stop in short term environment (like this strategy). Maybe a partial close of the order and a SL set to breakeven.

Usually, in the FreeCode section I uploads very raw concepts that can be improved with well-know [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions"), not complete EA that can be used as-is...

Hi Fabio, I want to share additional ideas on your concept .

The form of the candles like picture will caused of the problem. If we can filter it with [Stochastic](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so "MetaTrader 5 Help: Stochastic Oscillator Indicator") or MACD slope up/down trend may help.

The candle size also matter, if too small it will cause of easily touching SL

At the bottom most & top most trading has to be avoided with O/B & O/S indicators

[Entry Hour Stochastic Trader](/en/code/23958)

The One Hour Stoc Trader uses a simple trigger criteria of: Stochastic rising while in Over-Sold zone (stocval<Stoc\_Lo) and specific hour of day for Buy trades; and Stochastic falling while in Over-Bought zone (stocval>Stoc\_Hi) and specific hour of day for Sell trades. The one hour chart is used. The algorithm works well, after optimization, for the following currency pairs: EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY, EURGBP and AUDUSD. The following chart shows the Tester performance for the EURUSD currency pair on the 1hr chart for the period Jan 2010 thru Dec 2018.
