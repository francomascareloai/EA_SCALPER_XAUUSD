The [MQL5 Wizard](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate") allows creating ready-made Expert Advisors based on the [Standard library](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses) classes delivered together with the client terminal (see [Creating Ready-Made Expert Advisors in MQL5 Wizard](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate") for the details). It allows to check your trade ideas quickly, all you need is to create your own trading signals class. The structure of this class and example can be found in the article [MQL5 Wizard: How to Create a Module of Trading Signals](/en/articles/226).

The generic idea is the following: the class of trading signals is derived from [CExpertSignal](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal), the next, it's necessary to override the [LongCondition()](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal/cexpertsignallongcondition) and [ShortCondition()](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal/cexpertsignalshortcondition) virtual methods with your own methods.

There is a book ["Strategies of best traders](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.tora-centre.ru/book/strategy.htm "http://www.tora-centre.ru/book/strategy.htm")" (in Russian), there are many trading strategies are considered there, we will focus on reversal candlestick patterns, confirmed by [Stochastic](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so"), [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci"), [MFI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/market_facilitation "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/market_facilitation") and [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") oscillators.

The best way is to create the separate class, derived from [CExpertSignal](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal) for checking of formation of candlestick patterns. For confirmation of trade signals, generated by candlestick patterns, it's sufficient to write the class, derived from CCandlePattern and add the necessary features (for example, confirmation by oscillators) there.

Here we will consider the signals, based on "Hammer/Hanging Man" reversal candlestick pattern, confirmed by [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") indicator. The module of trade signals is based on the [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class, it's simple example of its use for creation of trade signals with candlestick patterns.

  

**1. "Hammer" and "Hanging Man" reversal candlestick patterns**

**1.1. Hammer**

The "Hammer" is a candlestick with a small body and long lower wick, formed after downward price movement. The "Hammer" pattern indicates the end of a bearish trend.

The color of a candlestick body isn't important, but bullish hammer indicates higher bullish potential. The body of the "Hammer" pattern often formed near the mininum of the previous candle. The longer lower wick and shorter upper wick leads to higher potential of the reversal pattern.

![Fig. 1. "Hammer" candlestick pattern](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/hammer_en__7.png "Fig. 1. \"Hammer\" candlestick pattern")

Fig. 1. "Hammer" candlestick pattern

The recognition of "Hammer" pattern is implemented in CheckPatternHammer() method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class:

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks formation of "Hammer" candlestick pattern                 |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool CCandlePattern::CheckPatternHammer()
  {
//--- Hammer
   if((MidPoint(1)<CloseAvg(2))                                 && // down trend
      (MathMin(Open(1),Close(1))>(High(1)-(High(1)-Low(1))/3.0)) && // body in upper 1/3
      (Close(1)<Close(2)) && (Open(1)<Open(2)))                    // body gap
      return(true);
//---
   return(false);
  }
```

The CheckCandlestickPattern(CANDLE\_PATTERN\_HAMMER) method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class is used to check formation of "Hammer" candlestick pattern.

  

**1.2. Hanging Man**

The "Hanging Man" is a candlestick with a small body and long lower wick, formed after upward price movement. The
"Hanging Man" pattern indicates the end of a bullish trend.

The color of a candlestick body isn't important, but bearish candle indicates higher bearish potential. The body of the "Hanging Man" pattern often formed near the maxinum of the previous candle. The longer lower wick and shorter upper wick leads to higher potential of
the reversal pattern.

![Fig. 2. "Hanging Man" candlestick pattern](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/hanging_man_en__7.png "Fig. 2. \"Hanging Man\" candlestick pattern")

Fig. 2. "Hanging Man" candlestick pattern

The recognition of "Hanging Man" pattern is implemented in CheckPatternHangingMan() method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class:

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks formation of "Hanging Man" candlestick pattern            |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool CCandlePattern::CheckPatternHangingMan()
  {
//--- Hanging man
   if((MidPoint(1)>CloseAvg(2))                                && // up trend
      (MathMin(Open(1),Close(1)>(High(1)-(High(1)-Low(1))/3.0)) && // body in upper 1/3
      (Close(1)>Close(2)) && (Open(1)>Open(2))))                  // body gap
      return(true);
//---
   return(false);
  }
```

The CheckCandlestickPattern(CANDLE\_PATTERN\_HANGING\_MAN) method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class is used to check formation of "Hanging Man" candlestick pattern.

  
  

**2. Trade signals, confirmed by RSI indicator**

The trading signals to open long or short position must be confirmed by [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") indicator. The value of RSI must be lower/greater than critical levels (40 for long position and 60 for short position).

The closing of opened position depends on the values of [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi"). It can be done in 2 cases:

1. if RSI has reached the opposite critical level (70 for long position and 30 for short position)
2. if the reverse signal isn't confirmed (when RSI reaches the following levels: 30 for long position and 70 for short position)

![Fig. 3. "Harami" pattern, confirmed by RSI indicator](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/Image_H_HM_RSI__2.png "Fig. 3. \"Harami\" pattern, confirmed by RSI indicator")

Fig. 3. "Harami" pattern, confirmed by RSI indicator

  

* int CH\_HM\_RSI::LongCondition() - checks conditions to open long position (returns 80) and close of the short position (returns 40);
* int CH\_HM\_RSI::ShortCondition() - checks conditions to open short position (returns 80) and close of the long position (returns 40).

  

**2.1. Open long position/Close short position**

1. The formation of "Hammer" pattern must be confirmed by [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") indicator: RSI(1)<40 (the value of the RSI of the last completed bar must be less than 40).
2. The short position must be closed if [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") indicator has crossed upward the critical levels 70 or 30.

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks conditions for entry and exit from market                 |
//| 1) Market entry (open long position, result=80)                  |
//| 2) Market exit (close short position, result=40)                 |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
int CH_HM_RSI::LongCondition()
  {
   int result=0;
//--- idx can be used to determine Expert Advisor work mode
//--- idx=0 - in this case EA checks trade conditions at each tick
//--- idx=1 - in this case EA checks trade consition only at news bars
   int idx   =StartIndex();

//--- checking of conditions to close short position
//--- signal line crossover of overbought/oversold levels (upward 30, upward 70)
  if(((RSI(1)>30) && (RSI(2)<30)) || ((RSI(1)>70) && (RSI(2)<70)))
     result=40;
//--- return result
   return(result);
  }
```

  

**2.2. Open short position/Close long position**

1. The formation of "Hanging Man" pattern must be confirmed by [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") indicator: RSI(1)>60 (the value of the RSI indicator of the last completed bar must be greater than 60).
2. The long position must be closed if [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") indicator has crossed downward the critical levels 70 or 30.

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks conditions for entry and exit from market                 |
//| 1) Market entry (open short position, result=80)                 |
//| 2) Market exit (close long position, result=40)                  |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
int CH_HM_RSI::ShortCondition()
  {
   int result=0;
//--- idx can be used to determine Expert Advisor work mode
//--- idx=0 - in this case EA checks trade conditions at each tick
//--- idx=1 - in this case EA checks trade consition only at news bars
   int idx   =StartIndex();

//--- checking of conditions to close long position
//--- signal line crossover of overbought/oversold levels (downward 70, downward 30)
   if(((RSI(1)<70) && (RSI(2)>70)) || ((RSI(1)<30) && (RSI(2)>30)))
     result=40;
//--- return result
   return(result);
  }
```

  
  

**2.3. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard**

The CH\_HM\_RSI class isn't included in the Standard Library classes, to use it, it's necessary to download the ach\_hm\_rsi.mqh file (see attachments) and save it to the client\_terminal\_data\folder\MQL5\Include\Expert\Signal\MySignals. The same should be done with the candlepatterns.mqh file. You can use it in MQL5 Wizard after restart of the MetaEditor.

To create an Expert Advisor launch [MQL5 Wizard](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate"):

![Fig. 4. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_1__22.png "Fig. 4. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard")

Fig. 4. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard

Let's specify the name of the Expert Advisor:

![Fig. 5. General properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_2_HHM_RSI__1.png "Fig. 5. General properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 5. General properties of the Expert Advisor

After that we need to select the modules of trade signals used.

![Fig. 6. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_3__22.png "Fig. 6. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 6. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor

In our case we use only one module of trade signals.

Adding the "**Signals based on Hammer/Hanging Man confirmed by RSI**" module of trading signals:

![Fig. 7. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_3_2_HHM_RSI__1.png "Fig. 7. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 7. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor

Module of trade signals added:

![Fig. 8. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_3_3_HHM_RSI__1.png "Fig. 8. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 8. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor

You can select any trailing properties, but we will use "Trailing Stop not used":

![Fig. 9. Trailing properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_4__23.png "Fig. 9. Trailing properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 9. Trailing properties of the Expert Advisor

Concerning the money management properties, we will use "Trading with fixed trade volume":

![Fig. 10. Money management properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_5__23.png "Fig. 10. Money management properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 10. Money management properties of the Expert Advisor

By pressing the "Finish" button, we will get the code of the generated Expert Advisor, located in Expert\_AH\_HM\_RSI.mq5, it will be saved in terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Experts\.

The default input parameters of the generated Expert Advisor:

```mql5
//--- inputs for main signal
input int            Signal_ThresholdOpen   =10;     // Signal threshold value to open [0...100]
input int            Signal_ThresholdClose  =10;     // Signal threshold value to close [0...100]
input double         Signal_PriceLevel      =0.0;    // Price level to execute a deal
input double         Signal_StopLevel       =50.0;   // Stop Loss level (in points)
input double         Signal_TakeLevel       =50.0;   // Take Profit level (in points)
```

must be replaced to:

```mql5
//--- inputs for main signal
input int            Signal_ThresholdOpen   =40;     // Signal threshold value to open [0...100]
input int            Signal_ThresholdClose  =20;     // Signal threshold value to close [0...100]
input double         Signal_PriceLevel      =0.0;    // Price level to execute a deal
input double         Signal_StopLevel       =0.0;    // Stop Loss level (in points)
input double         Signal_TakeLevel       =0.0;    // Take Profit level (in points)
```

The Signal\_ThresholdOpen/Signal\_ThresholdClose input parameters allow to specify threshold levels for open and close of positions.

In code of the LongCondition() and ShortCondition() methods of the trade signals class we have specified
the fixed values of the threshold:

* Open position: 80;
* Close position: 40.

The Expert Advisor, generated by MQL5 Wizard open and close position using the "votes" from the modules of trade signals. The vote of the main module (as container, it consist of all the modules added) is also used, but its LongCondition() and ShortCondition() methods always return 0.

The vote results of the main module is also used in "votes" averaging. In our case we have:  main module + 1 module of trade signals, so we need to take this fact into account when setting of the threshold values. Because of this fact the ThresholdOpen and ThresholdClose must be set as 40=(0+80)/2 and 20=(0+40)/2.

The values of  Signal\_StopLevel and Signal\_TakeLevel input parameters is set to 0, it means that closing of the positions will be done only when closing conditions will be true.

  

**2.4. History backtesting results**

Let's consider backtesting of the Expert Advisor on historical data (EURUSD H1, testing period:  2010.01.01-2011.03.03, PeriodRSI=33, MA\_period=2).

In creation of Expert Advisor we used the fixed volume ([Trading Fixed Lot](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/samplemmclasses/cmoneyfixedlot), 0.1), Trailing Stop algorithm is not used ([Trailing not used](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/sampletrailingclasses/ctrailingnone)).

![Fig. 11. Testing results of the Expert Advisor, based on Hammer/Hanging Man + RSI](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/HHM_RSI_Test_Results__1.png "Fig. 11. Testing results of the Expert Advisor, based on Hammer/Hanging Man + RSI")

Fig. 11. Testing results of the Expert Advisor, based on Hammer/Hanging Man + RSI

  

The best set of input parameters can be found using the [Strategy Tester](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/strategy-tester "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/strategy-tester") of MetaTrader 5 client terminal.

The code of the Expert Advisor, created by MQL5 Wizard is attached in expert\_ah\_hm\_rsi.mq5.

I tried to perform the exercise with this signal class, and something did not work at all.

First, using the debugger, I overcame the error that the initialisation of the m\_applied field of the signal class is not provided, because of which the RSI [indicator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/algotrading "Create an indicator in MetaTrader 5 client terminal") is not [created](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/algotrading "Create an indicator in MetaTrader 5 client terminal").

Then I found that in the CCandlePattern::CheckPatternHangingMan() method there seems to be a missing closing bracket for calling the MathMin() function:

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks formation of Hanging Man candlestick pattern              |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool CCandlePattern::CheckPatternHangingMan()
  {
//--- Hanging man
   if((MidPoint(1)>CloseAvg(2))                                 && // up trend
      (MathMin(Open(1),Close(1)>(High(1)-(High(1)-Low(1))/3.0)) && // body in upper 1/3
      (Close(1)>Close(2)) && (Open(1)>Open(2))))                   // body gap
      return(true);
//---
   return(false);
  }
```

Further in the debugger I see that short positions are opened by the condition for closing a long position. What can this be related to?

And another question: why is the code with comments in Russian in the description, but in the attached files it is not the same, but in English?
