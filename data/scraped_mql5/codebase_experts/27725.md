[Set Stoploss and Takeprofit at same level for multiple orders](/en/code/27684)

Let's say we have 20 open orders on one symbol and want to set takeprofit or stoploss for all of them at the same level(price) .The script selects all open orders of the symbol and can modify stoploss or takeprofit or both at the desired level (price).
If the input parameters are left to zero , the stop or the takeprofit are left unchanged .
