The Cincin EA (v2.24) is an automated trading system for MetaTrader 5 that executes conservative random trades on a specified symbol (e.g., EURUSD), with features like basket management, hedging, and position control. It opens buy or sell trades based on random decisions, respecting user-defined risk parameters, stop-loss/take-profit levels (using ATR or fixed pips), and a maximum daily trade limit. The EA monitors total profit/loss and closes all positions when profit/loss targets or position thresholds are reached, optionally using breakeven adjustments and hedging to mitigate losses. It includes safeguards like margin checks, market status validation, and minimum time/pip distances between trades to ensure disciplined trading.

**Please be aware: This EA is not designed for live trading. Using martingale strategies or increasing lot sizes could eventually lead to a complete loss of your balance. It is intended for demo and strategy testing only. The code requires significant updates before it is suitable for live trading. Consider it a work in progress and feel free to make improvements.**
