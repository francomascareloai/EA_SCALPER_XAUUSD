This is a pretty simple startegy that follows trend. Recommended time frame is D1.  

* when close price brakes up the EMA build based on high prices given that RSI is above 55 - expert buys.
* when close price brakes down the EMA build based on low prices given that RSI is below 45 - expert sells.
* system closes previose trade if there is opposite signal
* system uses take profit and stop loss

In the code your RSI do not follow.  
BUY >>  RSI > 40  
SELL>>  RSI < 65  
  
Maybe you should add that in the parameters with some defaults

Have you ever tested for time ranges ?

In the [strategy tester](/en/articles/239 "Article: The Fundamentals of Testing in MetaTrader 5 ") metatrader4 it starts opening trades and doesn't stop... I used "every tick" backtest, it looks to work "only open price" method. I think I should add some lines to the code and check that the bar is closed and new bar is opened.
