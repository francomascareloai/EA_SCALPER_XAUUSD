This Expert Advisor implements the trading strategy, based on the [Index Moving Average (IMA)](/en/code/146) indicator, its money management system dependent on the specified risk and loss size.

**The strategy**

The daily bars are used for trading. The signals checks when the new bar is appear.

The formulae is:

k=(ima0 – ima1)/|ima1|

where ima0 – the current value of IMA indicator, ima1 – is the previous value of the IMA indicator.

* Open long position, when k>= 0,5;
* Open short position, when k<= -0,5.

The management of opened position is based on the trailing stop, specified in the value of the **take** parameter.  
The loss trade is closed, according the specified **drop** parameter.

The lot size is changed with the minimal step up to the value, specified in **max\_lots** parameter.

If this value is equal to 0, the lot can be from the minimal up the maximal allowed for the symbol.

I don't know where it is published, the original version is loaded here. It is also loaded through Editor, in the library....

**Interesting:**  
 Не знаю где он опублекован, тут грузится первоначальный вариант. Через Эдитор, в библиотеку, тоже он грузится...

I have the corrected version loading.

**mvv444:**  

I'm loading the corrected version.

Three times tried to load here and twice from the library of the editor. The result is the same...

Maybe just in a post here you can put the new release?

**PS**

Checked again, from the site began to load a normal copy (without glitches), from the Editor is still available old...
