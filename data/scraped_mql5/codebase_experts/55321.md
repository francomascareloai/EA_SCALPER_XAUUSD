**Breakeven Line Indicator** is a MetaTrader indicator that calculates breakeven level based on all open positions and displays it on your chart as a horizontal line. Additionally, it will calculate the total number trades, the total number of lots, and the distance to the breakeven line in points and profit/loss. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

You can press the  Shift + B  keyboard shortcut to hide or show the breakeven line. The indicator supports multiple input parameters to configure the calculations and the looks.

## Input parameters

* **IgnoreLong** (default = false) — if *true*, the indicator will ignore long positions and will only calculate the breakeven line based on short positions.
* **IgnoreShort** (default = false) — if *true*, the indicator will ignore short positions and will only calculate the breakeven line based on long positions.
* **line\_color\_buy** (default = clrTeal) — the color for the breakeven line when the total cumulative position is long.
* **line\_color\_sell** (default = clrPink) — the color for the breakeven line when the total cumulative position is short.
* **line\_color\_neutral** (default = clrSlateGray) — the color for the breakeven line when the total cumulative position is neutral.
* **line\_style** (default = STYLE\_SOLID) — the breakeven line style.
* **line\_width** (default = 1) — the breakeven line width.
* **font\_color** (default = clrSlateGray) — text color.
* **font\_size** (default = 12) — text size.
* **font\_face** (default = "Courier") — text font face.
* **ObjectPrefix** (default = "BEL") — the prefix for chart objects' names. It lets the indicator avoid conflicts with other chart tools.
