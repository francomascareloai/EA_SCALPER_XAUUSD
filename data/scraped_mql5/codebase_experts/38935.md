Exports the transaction history of the current trading account.

The file is saved in the terminal folder **MQL5/Files** or in common folder for terminals **Common/Files**.

The file name is generated automatically or set manually via script parameters.

The history file can be used to simulate the same sequence of transactions on another trading server using the Simple History Receiver Expert Advisor or its open source version.

Parameters:

* **Name for file**: Set name for file or leave it blank for auto-generating filename.
* **Separators**: Set separators for data parts in CSV-file (comma ',' or semicolon ';') and sign for decimal point (dot '.' or comma ',')
* **Save file to Common Folder**: If True, file will be saved into Common/Files folder

Hi,  [Mohamad Jeha](/en/users/mohamadjeha)

If we need to save into csv-file some numbers, for example [1.01, 3.14, 7.28] we can use some symbol for separating one number from next number. This is a separator. Also we have to use some symbol as divider integer and fractional part of number. This is decimal point.

If separator is ';' and decimal point is '.' then into file will be saved following:

1.01;3.14;7.28

If separator is ';' and decimal point is ',' then into file will be saved following:

1,01;3,14;7,28

If separator is ',' and decimal point is '.' then into file will be saved following:

1.01,3.14,7.28

Which you choose depends from what program you will use for further handling exported data.
