hello can you add [order expiration](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_state "MQL5 documentation:") time option for limit orders ?

and for limit orders, an option to automatically place them xx pips away from current price would be useful. Like place a limit buy order 30 pips below current price automatically instead of requiring the trader to type the exact price.
