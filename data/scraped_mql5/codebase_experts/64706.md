This is another OHLC candlestick chart which finds the highest ask price and lowest bid price on each bar. It uses the high price of the candle to record the highest ask price in that bar (top wick) and uses the low of the candle to record the lowest bid price in that bar (bottom wick).

This way you will see the real tick volatility that is somewhat unapparent on lower timeframes. It could provide insight for where a tight stop loss really needs to be, and where it should not be.

Normal candlestick chart:

Edit:

v2 uploaded which is an optimized version whereby CopyTicksRange is called outside the loop so that there's less frequent function calls and less CPU load

I see you drew inspiration from a *certain place*, and decided to implement your own. Good for you! 👍

Very nice, and KISS principle compliant.

I can also envision a pullback trader inverting the bid price to highs, and the ask price to lows.,, and then placing **entry** orders just a tick or point above/below the most recent price extreme.
