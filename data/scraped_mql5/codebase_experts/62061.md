This indicator splits volume into buyer volume and seller volume, and a visualization of the volume pressure is drawn with overlaying histograms.

The indicator was initially part of trading software called "Amibroker". It was discussed on the forum, and was initially requested to be converted to mql4, however I decided to convert it to mql5 with my best understanding of the original indicator.

While I am the author of this mql5 conversion, I credit the original author Nick Molchanoff in the code who came up with the original design.

i would like to say **thank you to the author or developer of this indicator,** i manage to turn it into an Expert Advisor in MT5 and i am doing back testing for it in strategy tester.. even though its going downwards, i am using 1:3 risk ratio with **fixed 21 pips of stop loss and 7 pips take profit on GOLD**. I am using multiple time frame analysis for entering the market.

i am hoping this 100% back test modelling data will provide profits when i reverse the signal using the same risk ratio which is 1:3 , 7 pips SL and 21 pips TP on real account

Wish me luck...

Simply reversing the signals does not usually fix the problem. A losing system is not losing just for being "the wrong way around" but because its entries lack a positive edge.  
  
In addition, spread, commissions, and the SL/TP asymmetry make inverted rules almost always unprofitable. **The solution is not to flip the logic but to redesign the strategy from the ground up.**

thanks miguel for the advise, i am starting to realized that now.. im working on it as i go along.. following the indicator original signal has its edge, i just need to filter out the noise it creates so that it will enter the market at the right position.. or at least at the right trading session

As what was said...you cannot flip balance curves by "reversing the polarity" -- classic hollywood movie quote. You need to be careful, expert advisors are not to be "simply finished and used" by someone who has not been doing this too long. You have to understand that 7 pip and 21 pips means nothing on Gold. It's not a forex market, it's not using the same [contract size](/en/docs/constants/environment_state/marketinfoconstants#enum_symbol_info_double "MQL5 documentation: Symbol properties") as forex markets. Gold is measured in ounces....a 20 point move in a forex market is roughly comparing to a 200 point move in gold. You also need to realize that the current reading on this indicator can repaint, so you can't only use current reading in the expert advisor...you have to use current bar volume reading along with the completed volume reading on the two previous bars as well (roughly speaking).

Unfortunately I had to realise that some brokers are a bit careless with the server time changeover, which I had not expected and which surprised me a lot. Here is a script with which everyone can check their broker.
