Thanks a lot, i really like this EA. it s easy but really powerful.

I studied it for learning mql5 and i think it can be improved with some logic fix.

In code there is a set parameter: 13. The number is good enough but, what if the distance between thresholds is less than 13? :)))

This EA changes the TP and SL with each tick. Will the dealer complain that the traffic is too high?
