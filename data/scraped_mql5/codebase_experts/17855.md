DMI oscillator version of dsl (discontinued signal lines) family of indicators.

DMI short description ‌(since it is not widely known).

**DMI OSCILLATOR**  

Within
the suite of indicators that make up Wilder’s directional movement
index (DMI) are the plus directional movement indicator (+DI) and the
minus directional movement indicator (-DI). They provide the foundation
for the more widely recognized average directional index (ADX). Whereas
the ADX offers information about the strength of price movement but not
its direction, the +DI and -DI furnish information about the positive or
negative direction of price movement over a period of time.

Wilder
provides complete information about the function and construction of
all the components that make up the directional movement index in his
1978 book, *New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems*. In
general, the plus and minus components of the DMI focus on that portion
of the current bar’s trading range that is outside the range of the
previous price bar. If it is higher, it is considered to be positive (+)
and if it is lower, it is labeled negative (-). These values are
divided by the true range and averaged over time, usually 14 periods. A
move by the +DI above the -DI indicates that positive or upward price
direction has overtaken negative or downward price direction.
Conversely, when +DI falls below -DI, declining price either from
selling pressure or lack of upward price momentum is taking control.
Potential changes in direction or trend occur when the lines intersect.

‌As
with all the dsl indicators, it can be used both in trend and counter
trend trading, but the dsl in this case can add to momentum strength
estimation too.

Hi Mr.MLaden, DSL\_DMI\_Oscillator looks quite good. How do it work? Do you have any instructions to [use](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/array/arrayfill "MQL5 Documentation: ArrayFill function") it properly?

Please can you [check](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") for bugs?

Using the indicator from the original post with default parameters

So I am guessing that you are trying to use very short DMI period. In any case you can change lines 121 and 122 to this

```mql5
         double plusDI     = (atr!=0) ? 100*iCustomMa(DmiMaMethod,plusDM ,DmiPeriod,i,rates_total,1)/atr : 0;
         double minusDI    = (atr!=0) ? 100*iCustomMa(DmiMaMethod,minusDM,DmiPeriod,i,rates_total,2)/atr : 0;
```

I was using default settings, it appears to be working ok; so should I still make the changes above?

Thanks for replying.

How many buffers does your indicator use? What's it calculating? Is it efficient? If you want to know what's going on behind the scenes, you'll now be able to.
