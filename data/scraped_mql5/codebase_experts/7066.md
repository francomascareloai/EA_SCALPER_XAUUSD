Just draw Trend Up or Trend Down before the Expert Advisor "TrendMeLeaveMe" start. Set properties, run expert and go to sleep or work.  
  
This expert does not work automatically. You must draw trend up, trend down or horizontal trend. Name it **buystop** or **sellstop** , set **BuyStop\_StepUpper**, **BuyStop\_StepLower**, **SellStop\_StepUpper** and **SellStop\_StepLower** Properties.

**Rush59:**  

Hi guys, I have a couple of questions:

- how can I show the trendlines name in the Chart? (found, you have to place the same name in the Description)

- When you name the trendlines by the instructions, and start the Expert (a happy face visible in the right upper corner), you need to click in AutoTrading? how it works?

Regards,

Juan

Juan,

first, you need to buystop and sellstop [trend lines](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object "MQL5 documentation: Object Types"). You can rename them double click on the trend line and right click on the trendline and you will see trendline properties click general properties and name it and repeat this for the other trendline.

afterthat, choose the experts from the expert menu and drop on the chart and you will see happy face on the right corner. If you not click the autotrade from the expert properties

Could you add a feature for taking profit when a trendline, [horizontal line](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object "MQL5 documentation: Object Types") is touched by price?
