A well known "precision trend" indicator — made as a histogram version.

Indicator is similar
to some existing indicator, but there are some deviation which makes it
justifiable to have it as a separate indicator. It tends to be a good
indicator for trends. This version is the histogram version of
the indicator coloring the histogram bars according to the current "precision
trend" state.

And here is how it correlates to the "regular" version:

Huge appreciation for Mladen for creating this indicator, yet the only one problem with it is it doesn't plot any buffers in the indicator window which causes the indicator unavailable for EA automation.  
Hope fellow coders here can help add two simple 1 & 0 buffers for the bullish and bearish histograms.  
Much appreciated!

It's impossible to use it in a [backtest](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks "). since no buffers are shown nor the values are known
