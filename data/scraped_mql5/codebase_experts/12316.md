Hail Janderson, Excellent work! Thank you very much!

I would like to kindly ask you to launch Candle Size 2.0, with an upgrade that will add a lot, add the complete size of the candle, [that is,](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/calendar/calendarvaluebyid "MQL5 documentation: CalendarValueById function") add the body and the wicks and show in the centre of the candle.

Thank you in advance for your attention!

Keep up the excellent trading!

Best regards

The indicator loading is slow, also it's only showing on around last 50 bars.

Exactly Fernanda Janser, I was also looking for exactly that, an indicator that would calculate from the low to the high of the total candle, and tell you the total number of pips it had in the centre.

**Olexiy Polyakov novice traders know, that an ordinary ATR indicator with a period "1" will show you information about the size of the candle and the shadow with accuracy up to a pip, because all this is called by the term - VOLATILITY !!!!.**

Sorry, but this is not nonsense, but a different way of looking at the same thing.
