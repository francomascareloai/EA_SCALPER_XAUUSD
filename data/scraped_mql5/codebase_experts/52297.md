The **Doji Pattern Detector EA** is designed to automatically detect the classic **Doji candlestick pattern** on any chart. A Doji pattern occurs when the open and close prices of a candle are very close to each other, signaling market indecision. This EA identifies Doji candles where the open and close prices are within a small range and positioned near the midpoint of the candle's high and low.

#### Key Features:

1. **Doji Detection**:

   * The EA checks if the difference between the open and close prices is less than **3 points**.
   * It also verifies that the open and close are near the midpoint of the candle’s range (with a 10% tolerance).
2. **Chart Marking**:

   * When a Doji is detected, a **red arrow** is drawn 5 points below the candle’s low.
   * A label with the text **"Doji"** is placed 3 points below the arrow for easy identification.
3. **Alerts and Notifications**:

   * The EA generates an alert and displays a message when a Doji pattern is detected on the previous closed candle.

This EA is a valuable tool for traders looking to incorporate Doji patterns into their trading strategies, providing a clear visual and audible indication of market indecision or potential reversals.

These levels include the highest price (Max), the lowest price (Min), and the average price (Avg), providing traders with a clear visual reference for key support and resistance points.
