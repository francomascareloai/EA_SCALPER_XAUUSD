Thanks for this EA Ken,

Please I don't know what is wrong. Sometimes the EA Stop Loss doesn't work during backtesting

particularly if it is a [Sell Order](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_book_type "MQL5 documentation: Trade Orders in Depth Of Market"). Could it be a problem in the code or is from my broker's platform?

Thanks

![Time Frame Changer](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Time Frame Changer](/en/code/28111)

I recently needed an indicator that, once placed in a window, is able to change the Time Frame of all open windows.
In addition, I wanted this indicator to be able to react to Metatrader's Time Frame selection bar.
Despite my various searches, I couldn't find anything suitable. So I decided to develop my own indicator.
I propose it to you here.
