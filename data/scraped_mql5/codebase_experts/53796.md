The indicator draws the nearest levels of the specified price range.

In the settings, you can choose what to measure the range in, points or percentages.  
  
The principle of the indicator:

* 1. The user specifies the required price range in the settings,
* 2. The indicator scans the chart,
* 3. As soon as the difference between the Maximum and Minimum prices on the observation interval falls within the specified boundaries, the action stops and the price levels of the range are displayed on the chart.

Good job. But do people still use mql4? I think mql5 would have been better because it's modern.

mt4 is good. Some are not programmed in mt5. And that's pretty bad. I can't program mt4 and mt5 indicators myself. It's too complicated and hard to understand for me.

[MT4 to MT5 Convertor (MT5Compat.mqh)](/en/code/53546)

A new interface library has been developed to simplify converting MT4 indicators and Expert Advisors (EAs) to MT5. This library supports most of the MetaTrader 4 functions, offering developers a unified solution for cross-platform compatibility.
