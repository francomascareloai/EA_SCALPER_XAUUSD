Detrended Synthetic Price was originally developed by John Ehlers. There
are various ways of using it, but the one I found that they use mostly
(with fixed levels), is very limited in its usage (you have to adjust
the levels for each and every symbol, time frame or any settings of the
parameters).

Discontinued signal lines version seems to be a
reasonable choice for the indicator to use instead of those fixed
levels. This version is the bars version (colored bars drawn on the main
chart) of the basic oscillator indicator, and here is how it looks
compared to the oscillator )depending on the settings used for coloring
options) :

How many buffers does your indicator use? What's it calculating? Is it efficient? If you want to know what's going on behind the scenes, you'll now be able to.
