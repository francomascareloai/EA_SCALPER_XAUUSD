This is my translation of the code by Alexey Viktorov from MQL4 to MQL5. For those who work mainly on MQL5 it can be useful.

The indicator shows the price change in points and how many times there was a change for a selected period, unfortunately only from launch to stop.

No input parameters.

It can be used to determine the speed and/or acceleration of price changes. In the screenshot it can be seen that the Volume equals 44, the TickVolume indicator shows that the price increased in 27 ticks ("Tick up") and decreased in 17 ticks ("Tick down"). During this time, the price has increased by 53 points ("Pips up") and decreased by 9 points ("Pips down", in the fifth digit).

**Very important, all mathematical operations with the values of the indicator must be carried out in absolute values.**

**Valerkatol:**  
 This is not a working indicator. I think the error in bar search takes only the last tick, perhaps the author forgot to add some other add-ons here.

Where can I get a working one?

I don't have another one and don't expect to. I don't really want one.

**Alexey Viktorov:**  

There's no other, nor is there one in sight. No particular desire.

Why, is it useless in practice?

For me it is. I made it in the hope of getting something good, but I never found the criteria to understand it.
