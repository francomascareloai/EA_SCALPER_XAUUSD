Each individual trade request is written to "TradeRequest.csv" file in real time.

This file will become long with all trade information and will have its name updated automatically every day, using current date on the name, to
keep files small enough to be handled.

1 Trade request file will be created on common folder each day and they will accumulate in the folder.

a Timer is used to write to common folder, other 2 files:

Open Positions, with a summary of all the currently open positions in the account

Open Orders, with a summary of all the unfilled orders currently active in the account

Code can be modified to use pipes, sockets, webrequests or other methods to transmit data over the internet.

When you write the receiver side, make sure to check the age of the signal, before taking it

Master account equity is also transmitted with each trade information, so the receiver can act on sizing the trades.

Code has been compiled, is fully operational and is super fast, as of today.

Have fun !

If you want to show gratitude, to a lot of time you will save on writing a transmitter yourself, you can share your receivers for this
transmitter also. I will also appreciate.

-----  
2020/Mar/3 - Code Updated to version 4 and now already has a Socket Client embedded to send Messages with all Trading information to a
free message relay server on the cloud, where messages are relayed to free Receivers. With this implementation, the same Transmitter
already sends signals to local and remote computer.

I have decided to Go ahead and do the Receiver Side for MT4. It is ready and operational. The system accepts multiple receivers and multiple transmitter over the internet trade copying.   
  
But seems like MQL4 Community page only accepts No DLL codes... If someone knows how to overcome this limitation and publish codes with the use of DLL, I will be happy to share the MT4 Receiver.

Hi. Thanks for share.

I would like to know if in case of change the lot size of an opened position. Is the slave account will change the lot also?

Or if the opened position change the value of the stoploss for example, the slave account will change also?

I saw that the way you've choose to copy trades from one account to another is writing a CSV file with the informations. So the "master" write the file and the "slave" read the same file.

Do you know if is there any other way to do this kind of thing?

As the mql5 community did not support any. DLL files addons. You can add an external link for downloads it from another site like [GitHub](/go?link=https://forge.mql5.io/help/en/guide "MQL5 Algo Forge: Cloud Workspace for Algorithmic Trading Development").
