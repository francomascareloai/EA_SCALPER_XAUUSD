**This EA is a further development of the first**[NeuroNirvamanEA](/en/code/20708) version. Now, the EA has a working time interval from Start hour::Start minute to End hour::End minute

The trading system is based on a simple neural network. A similar code based on a bilayer neural network: [MTC Сombo](/en/code/16762 "MTC Сombo - Expert Advisor for MetaTrader 5").

The EA uses indicators [Laguerre\_PlusDi](/en/code/2308 "Laguerre_PlusDi - indicator for MetaTrader 5") (located in a separate window in the picture) and [SilverTrend\_Signal](/en/code/459 "SilverTrend_Signal - indicator for MetaTrader 5") (located in the main chart):

Before using it, the three optimization stages must be passed!

All optimization stages are performed in the "1 minute OHLC" mode.

### Step 1

Set parameter **Pass** to **1** - this is the key condition. At this stage, such parameters are optimized (please note columns "Start", "Step", and "End")

![NeuroNirvamanEA step 1](https://c.mql5.com/18/72/2018-05-11_13h22_46.png "NeuroNirvamanEA step 1")

### Step 2

Set parameter **Pass** to **2** - this is the key condition. Then unflag all the parameters that have been optimized at Step 1. At Step 2, such parameters are optimized (please note columns "Start", "Step", and "End")

![NeuroNirvamanEA step 2](https://c.mql5.com/18/72/2018-05-11_13h27_40.png "NeuroNirvamanEA step 2")

### Step 3

Set parameter **Pass** to **3** - this is the key condition. Then unflag all the parameters that have been optimized at Step 2. At Step 3, such parameters are optimized (please note columns "Start", "Step", and "End")

![NeuroNirvamanEA step 3](https://c.mql5.com/18/72/2018-05-11_13h35_40.png "NeuroNirvamanEA step 3")

Upon optimization, leave parameter **Pass** set to **3** and unflag the parameters optimized at Step 3. The EA is ready to go.

Good afternoon.

Vladimir, I downloaded your Expert Advisor and started to optimize its work.

At step 1 I set your recommended settings, in the Pass line I set 1.

Pair - EURUSD Time - H1

period from 01.10.2019 to 31.01.2020.

[I start the optimization](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/algotrading/strategy_optimization "Help: Optimizing Expert Advisors in the MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") - 512 out of 10 and a half thousand iterations are performed and stops, no calculations are made.

The running time is 2 seconds.

I tried deleting it from the terminal, loading it through the directory - Library and from this page, I tried loading it in another directory

in the Experts folder. The result is the same - 512 passes and no calculations.

What am I doing wrong?

According to your description of the Expert Advisor, it is a very interesting work.

I wanted to attach a file from the Journal, but I don't know whether it is the right one or not.

Thank you.

Read the description. Go through three steps to configure your network.

Good afternoon.

Can you please tell me if after all the 3-stage setup, you can select all the functions and run the EA in the optimizer. If yes, what functions should be selected during the general run?

Just variables with x... I understood that they are responsible for training, and they cannot be touched after the pass step.
