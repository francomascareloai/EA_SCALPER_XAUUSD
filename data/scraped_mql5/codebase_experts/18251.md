Hi Vladimir,

I am testing the EA and faced an issue, it doesn't open positions for [USDJPY](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/usdjpy "USDJPY chart: technical analysis") (even if it loads the history), only positions are open for EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF.

Do you recall what the reason could be?

I am using the default  settings.

Thank you in advance!

Krasimir

It is a very nice EA.

Trading volume remains fixed at 0.01 lots, is this normal?

It would be even better if compounding was possible.

Mysteriously none of these versions compile...must be a system that works and not offered for public use!

I specifically downloaded this code and [checked:](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") the code is perfectly compiled. Probably you are confusing something.
