Hello Friend. I start the EA in test, but after some trade it stops and in the notes I get the following word "receive new data and
try again open order" can you explain how can I do? Thanks.

Dear Niko

This is very intresting EA. I am testing it in real acc. I faced a problem.

when i run it at the first time it s open 2 positions at the same time : 1 buy 1 sell. is it normal? (can i stop it this?)

Your EA is trend based so i expected only one direction at the time.

Do you have an explenation for the setings of the EA?

Thank u Ioannis

Hello,

the expert need two indicators to run properly (are posted with the expert).

I don't know if you have put the indicators in the common folder called 'Indicators'.

If the problem persists, you can show me the log file to see what happen?.
