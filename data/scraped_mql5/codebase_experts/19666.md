A trading system based on [ColorJJRSX](/en/code/1594 "ColorJJRSX - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator signals with the possibility to set a fixed position holding time. A signal is formed at the close of a bar, if the direction of the indicator movement (the indicator color) has changed. Once position holding time exceeds a preset fixed limit, the position is immediately closed:

```mql5
input bool   TimeTrade=true;      //Enabling position exit by time
input uint   nTime=240;           //Open position holding time in minutes
```

This Expert Advisor uses the compiled indicator file **ColorJJRSX.ex5** for operation. Place it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the **TradeAlgorithms.mqh** library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578 "TradeAlgorithms - Library for MetaTrader 5").

Default input parameters of the Expert Advisor were used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit were not used during testing.
