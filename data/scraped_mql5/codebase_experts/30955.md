* **RED** determines take profit for SELL, SELL\_STOP, SELL\_LIMIT and stop loss for BUY, BUY\_STOP, BUY\_LIMIT.
* Green should always be above red.
* Aqua should always be above of current ask for BUY\_STOP and SELL\_LIMIT and below of current bid for SELL\_STOP and BUY\_LIMIT orders.

### **[ORDER MODIFICATION]**

* Select order on the listview.
* Lines will be adjusted automatically corresponding to order price, tp, and sl.

When I compile this program I'm getting the following error:  

cannot convert 0 to enum 'ENUM\_TRADE\_REQUEST\_ACTIONS' PeterPanel.mq5 740 28

How do we sort this issue?

For [ENUM\_TRADE\_REQUEST\_ACTIONS](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_trade_request_actions "MQL5 documentation: Trade Operation Types") issue, you have just to remove 0 between { } on lines 740 and 741

Like this

  MqlTradeRequest tReq = {};

  MqlTradeResult tRes = {};

[Strategy - Set And Forget (with anti-Martingale system)](/en/code/30938)

This strategy is the well known set & forget accompanied by the anti-martingale system. It is very useful if you are very busy in which you don't have time, you want to trade the London session while you are sleeping in USA, etc.

[Composite - structural design pattern](/en/code/30884)

Create an object tree which represents part-whole hierarchies, so that the client would treat objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
