**Real author:** Rafael Maia de Amorim

The trading system based on the three RVI oscillator signals from three different timeframes. The two oscillators are used to define a trend direction by the oscillator location relative to a signal line. The third one is used to detect a crossing of the indicator and the signal line. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is a crossing of a lower-timeframe oscillator with medium- and higher-timeframe ones by trend.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
