This is a simple but pretty effective EA I have been working on. It is a basic three moving average cross for opening orders, and it uses MACD as verification before opening.

Updated 08/30/2018:

This is a pretty major update. Now this EA includes money management based on fixed risk percentage. Also stop loss and take profit values are set using ATR ranges based on time periods.

Test it out and let me know if it works well for you, also please let me know if there are any features that may help the EA perform better.

1) I would like to know how exactly [MACD](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/macd "MetaTrader 5 Help: MACD Indicator") filters signals? Because the visualization shows that profitable trades are sometimes skipped, while losing trades are vice versa.

2) More details about MA crossing - is it a sell signal, for example, if the average MA crosses the slow one from top to bottom, and at the same time the fast MA is below the average and the slow one?

3) I would like the EA to be able to work on a netting account and with a fixed lot.

Basically, I have a couple of ideas for signal filters, if you are interested - write me.

![Schaff Trend Cycle - NonLag MA](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Schaff Trend Cycle - NonLag MA](/en/code/21787)

This version of Schaff Trend Cycle uses a much "faster" moving average than EMA (NonLag MA) for that calculation which makes the resulting MACD "faster" and thus the resulting Schaff Trend Cycle "faster" to to market changes.
