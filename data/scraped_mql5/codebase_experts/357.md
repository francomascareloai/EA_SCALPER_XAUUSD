The Buy/Sell signals of the indicator are based on crossover of two [Moving Averages](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma) with different periods.

The indicator has the following features:

1. Filter, based on RSI ([Relative Strength Index](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi)) indicator.
2. Movement confirmation filter.
3. Flat movement filter.

The checks are based on the 1st bar (completed).
