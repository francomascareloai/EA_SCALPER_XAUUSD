The Expert Advisor's trading is focused on the panic caused by the releases of important economic indicators in the FOREX market: we analyze the candlestick's High-Low and Open-Close values.

The Expert Advisor parameters are configured for trading EUR/USD on H1. Recommended initial deposit is $1000 or higher. You can try to increase profit by increasing the risk factor, but it is better to stick to money management rules and use them as is.

### Input Parameters

* **Trade parameters**
  + **Stop Loss (in pips)** - Stop Loss value.
  + **Take Profit (in pips)** - Take Profit value.
  + **Trailing Stop (in pips)** - trailing value.
  + **Trailing Step (in pips)** - trailing step value.
  + **Risk in percent for a deal from a free margin** - risk per trade as percent of free margin.
  + **Decreased factor (based on the history of trading)** - this factor is used in case of having losing trades.
  + **History days (only if "Decreased factor" > 0)** - the number of days for analyzing the trading history.
* **Difference parameters**
  + **Difference high#1 minus low#1 (in pips)** - the minimum value of candlestick's High minus Low;
  + **Difference open#1 minus close#1 (in pips)** - the minimum value of candlestick's Open minus Close.

### Example if testing on EURUSD, H1:

Greetings Vladimir.

I wanted to clarify whether this system is based on jumps after news.

I wanted to clarify whether you have a code for MQL5 [type of indicator](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/mql5_programm_info#enum_program_type "MQL5 Documentation: Information about the launched MQL5 programme") with a call through iCustom.

Which reflects the news line and its importance on the chart for a currency pair.

One of the examples for MQL4

In MQL5, the CalendarCountries function for working with the calendar has appeared. I think it is time to use it for working with news.
