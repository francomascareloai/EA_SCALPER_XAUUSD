Hi,

Back tested the code. Excellent !!!

When i am trying to do live trades.. I am not seeing any trades happening. I am currently running it on a [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"). Please help how to initiate the trade.

Dear Antonis Michos,  
I would like to know how to set other values (0.05> 0.01) for WPPeriod, other settings for killer\_sell\_2.0.mq4 EA? Because he rarely makes the M5 on [EURUSD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/eurusd "EURUSD chart: technical analysis") and is in the wrong position? What and how to adjust for better performance?I don't get results in the tester, only "0" values everywhere!  
Please help, I'm disabled!  
Look forward to your reply  
Regards freeman
