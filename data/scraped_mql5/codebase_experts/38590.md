It is definitely going to be useful.

I suggest making it sort of stop repainting by editing the following line in the code

```mql5
ma[pos] = iMA(NULL, 0, MA_PERIOD, 0, MA_METHOD, MA_PRICE, pos);
```

to add a shift

```mql5
ma[pos] = iMA(NULL, 0, MA_PERIOD, 0, MA_METHOD, MA_PRICE, pos+1);
```

[Recursive Moving Average](/en/code/38598)

Recursive Moving Average calls itself a number of times in order to reach the appropriate smoothing. For instance DEMA,TEMA and Rainbow indicators are recursive exponential moving averages. The goal is to remove the loop limit while still running fast. In addition a trigger line provides the trading signal.
