[Translating mouse click on chart into price value (Helper function)](/en/code/46320)

This is a helper function which enables you to find the price of the symbol (the prices on the Y-axis) wherever you click the mouse on the chart.
Using OnChartEvent, we don't have an MQL5 function in the API to do this, we can only obtain X and Y pixel values with mouse click.
