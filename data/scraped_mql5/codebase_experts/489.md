This indicator is a modified variant of the [Commodity Channel Index (CCI)](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci").

The main difference of this indicator from its standard equivalent is the possibility to change the smoothing algorithm by selecting an appropriate one out of ten algorithms present:

1. [SMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - simple moving average;
2. [EMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - exponential moving average;
3. [SMMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - smoothed moving average;
4. [LWMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - linear weighted moving average;
5. [JJMA](/en/code/427) - JMA adaptive average;
6. [JurX](/en/code/436) - ultralinear smoothing;
7. [ParMA](/en/code/433) - parabolic smoothing;
8. [T3](/en/code/424) - Tillson's multiple exponential smoothing;
9. [VIDYA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/vida "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/vida") - smoothing with the use of Tushar Chande's algorithm;
10. [AMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ama "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ama") - smoothing with the use of Perry Kaufman's algorithm.

It should be noted that Phase parameter has completely different meaning for different smoothing algorithms.

* For JMA it is an external Phase variable changing from -100 to +100.
* For T3 it is a smoothing ratio multiplied by 100 for better visualization;
* For VIDYA it is a CMO period, for AMA it is a slow EMA period;
* For AMA fast EMA period is a fixed value and is equal to 2 by default. The ratio of raising to the power is also equal to 2 for AMA.

It is quite natural that some smoothing variants require some different interpretation of the indicator signals. Oversold/overbought levels are indicated in dynamically changing variant based on the [Bollinger Bands ®](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/bb "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/bb") to provide more accurate work with them.

The indicator uses SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library classes (must be placed to the terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Include). The use of the classes was thoroughly described in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).

**Rosh:**  

[XCCX](/en/code/489):

Author: [Nikolay Kositsin](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/GODZILLA "https://www.mql5.com/en/users/GODZILLA")

The second file CCI BB is not compiled and not put on the chart gives 4 errors, in contrast to say from your other indicators for example XRSX - put all three of them amicably and do not write any errors when compiling.

Adapted from [Backtesting to Find a More Reliable CCI Signal](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/post_of_the_day/2014/01/02/Backtesting_to_Find_a_More_Reliable_CCI_Signal.html "http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/post_of_the_day/2014/01/02/Backtesting_to_Find_a_More_Reliable_CCI_Signal.html") article

* CCI uses overbought and oversold levels to signal buy/sell entries.
* Only taking signals after a more extreme CCI reading could produce more reliable trades.

As traders, we should always be investigating ways to find a new edge or to increase the edge that we already have in our strategies. When I first began trading, this meant attempting to combine multiple indicators together, adjusting parameters for each one, and creating new, more complicated indicators in hopes of turning a profit. But after my first two years of trading, I discovered that often times the simplest strategies are the ones that give me the results I am looking for.

Looking for simpler strategies is what led me to an idea about using the CCI in a way that I have never personally researched before. Please note that to gain full value from this article, it requires that you know the basics of reading the CCI (buying when CCI crosses above -100, selling when CCI crosses below +100).

Stalin is one of the so-called «signal» indicators, as it provides a trader with accurate market entry points.

DailyPivot\_Shift indicator differs from the common DailyPivot indicator, as the main levels can be calculated with day start shift.

ATR Channels create price movement channels considering ATR (Average True Range).
