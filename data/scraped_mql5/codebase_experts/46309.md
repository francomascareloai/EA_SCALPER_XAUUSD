**Trading Logic:**  
The EA opens positions randomly (50/50 chance for Buy or Sell) when no position is open. Position size is calculated based on the risk percentage and stop loss distance, ensuring consistent risk per trade. The EA includes built-in safety features like margin checking and proper lot size validation.  
  
**Risk Management:**  
- Dynamic position sizing based on account risk percentage  
- Automatic lot size adjustment for margin requirements  
- Breakeven feature to protect profits  
- 10% margin buffer for safety  
- Proper handling of broker's minimum/maximum lot sizes

Note: Past performance does not guarantee future results. Always use proper risk management and test thoroughly on a demo account before live trading.
