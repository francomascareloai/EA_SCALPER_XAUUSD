Trading system based on the signals of the [MFI\_Slowdown](/en/code/16527) indicator. A signal is generated at the close of a bar if a colored indicator arrow has appeared.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file MFI\_Slowdown.ex5 in order to run. Place it to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
