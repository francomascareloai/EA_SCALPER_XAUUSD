The EA is based on three iMA (Moving Average, MA) indicators using the MODE\_SMA averaging method (Simple averaging). It works on every tick.

### Signal for opening a BUY position

"MA 1", "MA 2" and "MA 3" indicator values are taken from the bar #0.

"MA 1" is above "MA 2" by **MA's spread** points, while "MA 2" indicator is above "MA 3" by **MA's spread** points:

![3sma](https://c.mql5.com/18/70/3sma.png "3sma")

### Signal for opening a SELL position

"MA 1", "MA 2" and "MA 3" indicator values are taken from the bar #0.

"MA 1" indicator is below "MA 2" by **MA's spread** points, while "MA 2" is below "MA 3" by **MA's spread** points.

### Limitations for position opening

If at the moment, there are BUY positions opened by this EA, then the BUY signal is ignored. The same is done with the SELL signal.

### Closing Positions

"MA 1" and "MA 2" indicator values are taken from the bar #0.

* If "MA 1" is less than "MA 2" for the half of **MA's spread** → close BUY position;
* If "MA 1" is above "MA 2" for the half of **MA's spread** → close SEll position.
