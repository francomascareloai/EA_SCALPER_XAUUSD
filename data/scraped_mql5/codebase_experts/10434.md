### Description:

You and I both known zigzag indicator, it's good indicator! But zigzag
line can change depend on the price.

It's not fixed at the time.
The post-zigzag can count the moving of zigzag line. If see many
continuous post on screen, It's will more signal for changing the trend of price.

After I downloaded, compiled the source file, a post-zigzag  object was added appeared in teh Expert Adviser branch, even after I re-started the MT4 client. After inserted the post-zigzap object into the chart, nothing happened, 
even after I re-started the MT4 client. I dont know what is the problem. if anyone can help tackle this wierd issued, I will be grateful.

YangTrader is a good indicator, it core is price moving and return, when the value crosses 15, maybe it's the best buy time and down cross 80 it's the sell time.
