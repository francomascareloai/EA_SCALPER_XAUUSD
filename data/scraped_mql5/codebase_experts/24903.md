If your broker is dubious or not providing the best service to you, this expert will be a prove to you.

It is strictly for daily chart and it works  best on EURUSD and USDJPY.

### **most importantly,**

your Broker must be the one providing low spread if this expert would be working with it.

**Kenneth Bachelor:**  
 I find it very difficult to do anything without having any idea why I'm doing it. Since I wrote the above message, I haven't had a trade on my live platform in spite of the trades being called a 'Daily Gamble'. I expected the word daily to imply 1 trade a day, but it obviously doesn't so I'm going to have to give up on this.

if (you have not done so)

                       {

Download any of the following MT4 [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties") ant test it on their platform: 1...NPBFX MT4 demo   
2......ICMarkets MT4 Demo   
3.....Dukascopy MT4 Demo  
Let us know if you have the same result.

                     } else{  
  
The reason i called the trade comment "Daily Gamble " is because not all days end up with profit;  
  
I am already testing it demo which i will transfer to real market soon.

I mentioned previously that I'd made some minor modifications but I never told you what, so here's the change I made so that my trade size is linked to my account equity by the lots setting instead of being a fixed proportion.

/\* KB   double lot = MathMax(NormalizeDouble(0.00001\*AccountEquity(),2),MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE\_MINLOT));\*/  
   double lot = MathMax(NormalizeDouble(lots/100\*AccountEquity(),1),MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE\_MINLOT));

I've noticed that usually (but not always) trades are opened at 16:00 UK time (18:00 Server time) and close when the markets open for the following day having generated overnight SWAP. I'm not much of a programmer but if the trade is long and going to close at the next day's open, I would like it to close at the end of the current day. Is there a setting or a section of the code I can change to achieve this?

I will work it out to make it close at  30 seconds before the close of the day.

You can use

```mql5
if(Hour() == your_broker_closing_hour && Minute() == 59 && Seconds()== 20) OrdderClose(.........);
```

Also i will send the updated version that addresses all issues and bugs here when i am through with it.

When testing it on my [real account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties") , i discovered some new improvement needed to be made to the code to enhance it profitability.
