The EA trades by a single iMA (Moving Average, MA) indicator. All indicator parameters are included to the inputs. Operation is performed at each tick: as soon as a signal is received and there are no open positions in the direction of a signal, the signal can be executed.

### Position opening decision logic

Indicator data are taken from **Current Bar (get MA)**. Open, High and Low data are taken from **Current Bar (get OHLC)**. Conditions for being in the channel, where the upper border is calculated as "MA" plus **Ceiling of the channel** and the lower one is "MA" minus **Floor of the channel**.

### Levels

**Stop Loss** and **Take Profit** parameters can be disabled. To do this, set "0". Keep in mind that if **Stop Loss** is "0", we may receive frozen loss-making positions that are never closed by the EA.

Sample test on EURUSD M15:
