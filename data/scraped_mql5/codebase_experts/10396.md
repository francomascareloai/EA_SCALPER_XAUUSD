**starlimit03:**  

**basisforex:**  

It will be good to see any comments, ideas for better EA.

Good EA though,nice work...... some sugestions--- include if price> MA {by x pips}==buy && if price< MA {by x pips}==sell

and time to trade.... Also, is there no way trades can be taken when theres no cross at least to cater for the long trend moves...nice work. good DD

may be a good idea. will have to try.

"when theres no cross" - no trades.

**EADeveloper:**  

Nice idea, but if you tell us your idea about pair/timeframe maybe we have more success by testing :-)

Pair = [EURUSD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/eurusd "EURUSD chart: technical analysis")

TimeFrame = H1

Of course, the results of the testing various between dialing desks

Would have been nice to mention the EA is dependent upon the indicator being present, rather than just that it is based on the indicator.

![Profits your EA(s)  have made on your account](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Profits your EA(s) have made on your account](/en/code/10387)

These indicators are made to show how much profit your EA have made in a certain period.

![Fibo Moving Average](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Fibo Moving Average](/en/code/10383)

Calculates the Moving average indicator based on Fibonacci value.

[204060 Program AIGrid System](/en/code/10398)

Grid is a money maker in weak market, while a disaster in trending market. Maybe you can consider close all positions at some time, and run it totally again at another time, just like a fisher. This is AIGrid System With Manual Control.

[Highest - Lowest](/en/code/10401)

Simple chart to display the highest and lowest values for a data series over "n" bars period.
