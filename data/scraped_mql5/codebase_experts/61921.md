'Seven strategies in One exper' or 'MultiStrategyEA' it's a system it includes the code of seven different experts in one expert.

The experts included are as follows, AC\_Expert, ADX\_Expert, AO\_Expert, DeM\_Expert, ForceBB\_Expert, MFI\_Expert, MS\_Expert.

It has many parameters so that each user can find the appropriate settings that suit their investment profile.

It can work on 28 different pairs, one pair per chart.

The default parameter settings are indicative,

I recommend that each user experiment to find their own settings.

Hi, I'm a beginner, I ran the code and it seems to have really good results. But I got stuck in choosing the best indicators. Thanks in advance for your answer

Hi,

To find the right settings, you need to take the time to do a lot of testing.

This process is always time-consuming, but so necessary.

Best regards.

I have made some optimizations to your code, Nikolaos Pantzos, and I am attaching it for your review. It compiles successfully, but only you can determine if it aligns with your original version. Additionally, I was curious if you traded futures on LIFFE or EUREX during the 80s and 90s, or if I might be confusing you with someone else.

Very nice!

I don't know about the trader you're talking about. It wasn't me, anyway.
