The library of technical indicators for MetaTrader 4 developed in MQL4. Regardless of the market (forex, securities or commodity market), indicators help to represent quotes in an accessible form for easy perception.

This section contains thousands of applications that analyze financial markets using different algorithms. Conventionally, they can be divided into a few categories: trend indicators, oscillators, volume indicators and so on. In addition, there are sets of indicators based on algorithms by famous financiers. For example, Bill Williams' indicators and likes of it. All of them are characterized by different parameters of reliability, efficiency, lagging and others. There are more than 2000 indicators for technical analysis: trend indicators, reversal indicators, indicators of levels, predictors, scalping indicators and many others.
