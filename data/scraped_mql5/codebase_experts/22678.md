**Idea by:** [Marc Boggs](/en/users/marcboggs "Marc Boggs (marcboggs)")

**Code mq5 by:** [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn)

**The EA works on hedge accounts ONLY!**

In the EA, classes [CPositionInfo](/en/docs/standardlibrary/tradeclasses/cpositioninfo), [CTrade](/en/docs/standardlibrary/tradeclasses/ctrade), [CSymbolInfo](/en/docs/standardlibrary/tradeclasses/csymbolinfo), [CAccountInfo](/en/docs/standardlibrary/tradeclasses/caccountinfo), [COrderInfo](/en/docs/standardlibrary/tradeclasses/corderinfo), and [CArrayObj](/en/docs/standardlibrary/datastructures/carrayobj) were used.

Four levels, i.e., the spaces for placing pending orders, can be specified in input parameters. The sizes of the spaces follows the logic below:

**Level #0** < **Level #1** < **Level #2** < **Level #3**

The EA permanently monitors the situation, i.e., it works on each tick, as soon as the price breaks through one of the lines of indicator iBands (Bollinger Bands, BB) at the distance of **Level #3**. As soon as such breakthrough is found, pending orders will be placed. In the picture below, you can see a sample situation where the breakthrough of the upper line is found: Four Sell stop orders were placed

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/75/2018-10-10_16h04_02.png)

Accordingly, as soon as the lower line is broken through, pending Buy stop orders will be placed.

For each pending order, **Pending Stop orders expiration time** (in minutes) is set. You can specify both permanent and dynamic (in risk percents) lot sizes. Lot type is specified in **Money management**.

Parameters, such as **Stop Loss**, **Take Profit**, and **Trailing Stop**, can be disabled. To do so, you just have to assign the value of 0.0 to the parameter.

A sample start on EURUSD,H1

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/75/2018-10-10_17h18_58.png)

and on USDJPY,H1

I just saw this conversion to mql5.  I do have a newer version that perhaps you might like to try and modify.  
  
Best Regards,

The code is awesome but i need buylimit and [selllimit orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_book_type "MQL5 documentation: Trade Orders in Depth Of Market") .
Any order change option in the program please tell me .
The pending order in the program I see a switch case function and order type but can not switching the selllimit and buylimit option Add Order type option -buystop,sellstop& buylimit, selllimit & etc..
