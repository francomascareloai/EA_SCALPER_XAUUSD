**Basing Candlesticks MetaTrader indicator** — is an automatic indicator that detects and marks basing candles on the chart. A basing candle is a candle with body length less than 50% of its high-low range. The indicator highlights the basing candles using histogram lines (in MT4) or custom candles (in MT5) directly in the main chart of the platform. The percentage criterion can be changed via input parameters. You can also turn on alerts for when a new basing candle appears.

## Input parameters

* **Percentage** (default = 50) — percentage value to compare the ratio of the candle's body to its high-low range.
* **TriggerCandle** (default = 1) — candlestick number to check for alerts. "1" is the latest fully formed candlestick. "0" is the current candlestick, which hasn't yet finished forming.
* **EnableNativeAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, MetaTrader's native pop-up alerts will be used on new basing candle appearance.
* **EnableSoundAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, sound alerts will be used on new basing candle appearance.
* **EnableEmailAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, MetaTrader's email alerts will be sent on new basing candle appearance. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **EnablePushAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, MetaTrader's push notification alerts will be sent to your device upon new basing candle appearance. Notifications should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications*.
* **AlertEmailSubject** (default = "") — additional text for alert's email subject.
* **AlertText** (default = "") — additional text for alerts.
* **SoundFileName** (default = "alert.wav") — sound file name to play on alert if **EnableSoundAlerts** is set to *true*.

[Aroon Up, Down MT5](/en/code/55349)

Aroon Up & Down MetaTrader indicator — detecting the local tops and bottoms of the chart it was applied to, this indicator provides the signals for buying and selling the currency pairs when they rise up from the bottom and fall from the top. The cross of the indicator lines provide a good signal to take the profit or to exit with a minimum loss. This indicator can send sound and e-mail alerts on the cross. It is available in both MT4 and MT5 versions.

3rd Generation Moving Average is an advanced version of the standard moving average (MA) indicator for MetaTrader. It implements a rather simple lag-reducing procedure based on the longer MA period. The method was first described by M. Duerschner in his article Gleitende Durchschnitte 3.0 (in German). The presented version uses λ = 2, which provides the best possible lag-reducing. Higher λ increases similarity with the classic moving average. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5. It does not require using any DLL

BB MACD MetaTrader indicator — is a basic MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator variation, which helps in detecting the trend change points and measuring the current trend's strength. The indicator is drawn in the separate window on the chart and consists of two lines (blue and red) and the dots, which can be either green or magenta. The change of the dots' color is a good signal provider, while the width of gap between the two lines indicates the strength of the current trend. This indicator is available for MT4 and MT5.

![Beginner indicator MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Beginner indicator MT5](/en/code/55355)

Beginner MetaTrader indicator — a very simple custom indicator that displays the local tops and bottoms on the chart with the red and blue dots near them. It analyzes the maximum and minimums on the certain period and then compares them to the range, in which the currency pair was trading, and if the top/bottom is significant enough, it marks it with the dot. This indicator redraws itself and thus should not be used for generating trading signals as the dots' positions may change. Both MT4 and MT5 versions of the indicator are available.
