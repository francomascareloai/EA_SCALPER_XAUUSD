Interesting indicator, I have been using a "Twin Hull" system, Basis crossover, and [manually trading](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/5268 "Article: Reversal: formalizing the entry point and writing a manual trading algorithm "). I do feel an EA on this system would be practical.   
I trade mostly on 10 min charts, Hull Slow 10 Period Medium Sea Green, Orange Red, Fast 5 period Dodger Blue, Lavender.  
I admit that it takes a little more than the crossover, candle time is very important as is the price with respect to above or below 20/50 MAs. other indicators I use are a Twin RSI setup, and of course MACD.

As you have posted MAPlus, I thought you would like to know of my efforts, if you feel it could make a workable EA be my guest, my programming skills are non existent, so, if you do make something of my ideas,trading system I would appreciate feed back
