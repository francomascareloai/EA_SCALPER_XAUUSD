The Expert Advisor changes a financial instrument by drag-and-drop from the "Market Watch" window.

The user just needs to drag the financial instrument to the chart window where the advisor is installed.

Thus, the trader can quickly view any financial instruments in all his open charts without changing templates and profiles.

When you change a financial instrument, only the instrument changes in the charts. The chart period, indicators and their settings remain unchanged.

VR Watch List and Linker Lite is a light, open source version of VR Watch list and linker

**Recommendation:**

Install an advisor in each window, then it will not matter to which window you drag the financial instrument.

**Warning:**

When changing a financial instrument in windows, all indicators and advisors will be reinitialized.

If the advisor traded on EURUSD, then after changing the financial instrument, the advisor will start trading on the new instrument.

This indicator draws a trend-line directly on a chart. It uses the Theil Sen Estimation method to calculate the slope of the trend-line. Theil–Sen estimation is a method for robustly fitting a line to sample points in the plane (simple linear regression) by choosing the median of the slopes of all lines through pairs of points.
