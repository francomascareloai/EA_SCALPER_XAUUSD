All of the functions used in the Expert Advisor are found in the ImportantFunctions.mqh include file.

There are 2 Expert Advisors, both using the price crossing the moving average as their entry signal, with a simple difference: one uses Martingale when losses occur, and the other does not.

I don't recommend using any of the EAs with a live account, they are made for demonstration purposes only.

### Simple Moving Average EA Inputs:

* **MAPeriod**: The period of the Moving Average indicator.
* **LotSize**: The lot size used to enter trades.
* **TPPoints**: Take profit points.
* **SLPoints**: Stop loss points.

### Moving Average EA with Martingale Inputs:

* **MAPeriod**: The period of the Moving Average indicator.
* **StartingLot**: The lot size used to enter the first trade; this value will increase after a loss.
* **MaxLot**: The maximum lot size. The StartingLot can be increased until this value.
* **TPPoints**: Take profit points. This will increase after a loss.
* **SLPoints**: Stop loss points. This will increase after a loss.
* **LotMultiplier**: The lot size will be multiplied by this value after a loss if it has not reached the MaxLot value yet.
* **TPMultiplier**: The Take profit and Stop loss will both increase by this amount after a loss, providing a recovery edge not only through position sizing but also because of the bigger TP.

The code contains comments, and I've made a YouTube video explaining everything you need to understand.

Thanks for reading!

Hi Peter,

I don't understand the last two ifs in the RoundtoLots function:

...

 if(SymbolInfoDouble(\_Symbol,[SYMBOL\_VOLUME\_MIN](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/marketinfoconstants#enum_symbol_info_double "MQL5 documentation: Symbol properties")) == 0.001)

      ret = RoundDown(Val,3);

  if(SymbolInfoDouble(\_Symbol,SYMBOL\_VOLUME\_MIN) == 0.001)

      ret = RoundDown(Val,0);

...

Both if statements are identical.

What is the meaning of this?

Thanks

You are right, the last if statement is not needed, I updated the mqh file. Thanks for noticing it

U can't use these indexes MAArray[0] and  MAArray[1] without setting the MA buffer to series, you're making a mistake here, you will not get the MA data for the latest bar
