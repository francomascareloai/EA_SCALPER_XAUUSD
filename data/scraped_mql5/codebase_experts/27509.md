May you make the next version to have an option of number of trades to open...

For Example when I am using a broker that has a maximum leverage of 20 lots and I want to trade 40 lots. I will have to open 2 trades of 20 lots each.

Therefore using that option I'll choose 20 lots and 2 trades at 13:00.

This EA is just what I was looking for, great but I think it has a bug in both v.1.6 and v.1.7. In tests, he opens another order once the [stop loss](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders") is reached. I have noticed that this problem only occurs if one of the two orders is closed before the set hour candle. Can it be repaired? Thank you
