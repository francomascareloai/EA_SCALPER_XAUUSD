T3 indicator is proposed by Tim Tillson in 1998.

The reason of development of this new moving average was to improve the noise filter and decrease a lag, presented in most of the moving averages. The indicator is based on multiple exponential smoothing of price. Trade signals are: buy when price crossover the indicator upward and sell in case of downward crossover.

The indicator uses CT3 class of SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library, the details can be found in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).

What does the myriad of existing indicators tell us? Is it about the multitude of ways (approaches) of price calculation or about their impotence?
