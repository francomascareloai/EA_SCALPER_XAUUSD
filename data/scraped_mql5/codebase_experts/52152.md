This EA is a comprehensive trading tool designed for both novice and experienced traders who seek an automated strategy that adapts to market conditions. It implements a multi-step process that includes market analysis, risk management, and trade optimization:

1. **Signal Detection:** The EA continuously monitors the market using RSI for overbought/oversold conditions and moving averages to identify trends. It uses the ATR indicator to assess market volatility and adjust trading parameters dynamically.
2. **Risk Management:** Risk management is at the heart of this EA. It calculates lot sizes based on the account balance and risk percentage, setting stop-loss and take-profit levels according to market conditions. Trailing stop functionality allows for maximizing profits while minimizing potential losses as trades move in a favorable direction.
3. **Dynamic Parameter Optimization:** Periodically optimizes trading parameters such as RSI period, ATR multipliers, and trailing stop levels to adapt to market changes. It also adjusts risk based on the EA's win/loss performance, increasing or decreasing exposure to safeguard the account.
4. **Market Conditions Check:** Incorporates spread checks and high-impact news avoidance to ensure trades are executed only when market conditions are favorable, reducing unnecessary risk.

This EA is versatile, with built-in features to adapt to varying market conditions. However, it is recommended to thoroughly test and optimize the EA in a demo environment before deploying it on a live account.

Very interesting, but the same thing happens to me. In backtest it doesn't open or close operations. Any adjustments to make?

**Emmetcash100 [#](/en/forum/473139#comment_54604199):**  
 Works good

Really? It shouldn't have) This EA is just an example of MQL5 coding) Don't use it for trading. There are some holes in the code. For example, the function for backtesting results is empty:

```mql5
// Function to perform backtesting with given parameters
double BacktestWithParameters(int rsiPeriod, double atrMultiplier, double trailingStopMultiplier, double trailingTPMultiplier) {
    // Placeholder for backtesting logic
    double simulatedProfit = 0.0;
    
    // Implement real backtesting logic using historical data (this is a placeholder)
    return simulatedProfit;
}
```

And so on

What's the point of posting this while its missing some important functions to make it really work? It would be nicer to show the [full code](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_initialization/matrix_full "MQL5 Documentation: function Full") atleast an example.
