This expert is a system to help any trader to make a grid of orders (without martingale, lite martingale, or full martingale) easy and simple.

Please make your test to find your settings.

Default settings are just to take an idea of how the expert works.

The expert can make according or contrary grid of orders.

You can set the expert to work in hedge mode if the losses are huge.

The system uses a high-risk strategy. It's better to test it first in a demo account.

I tested this EA on a [strategy tester](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/239 "Article: The Fundamentals of Testing in MetaTrader 5 ") and now for a few days on a demo account, and the results are really good. I know it's a grid account and therefore carries a high risk of loss in strong trending markets, but effective money management is essential. Thank you for the source code for this EA.

MA Cross Alert is a custom MT4 indicator that solves one key problem: MetaTrader’s built-in Moving Average shows the line but has no way to alert you when price crosses it.

![Trend Vision MT4 Indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Trend Vision MT4 Indicator](/en/code/64055)

Trend Vision is a custom MT4 indicator that combines MACD momentum with Bollinger Bands volatility to give clear, reliable trading signals.
MACD shows momentum shifts, divergence, and trend strength.
Bollinger Bands measure volatility, expansion, and squeezes.
By fusing these two, Trend Vision filters out false moves and highlights only the high-probability moments when both momentum and volatility agree.
