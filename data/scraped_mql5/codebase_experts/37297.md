This is the indicator originally posted here [Limit channels](/en/code/37271) that is extended with a display of "states".

* "states" are displayed as colored histogram
* they can be calculated using :

+ level 3 - outer levels - the "slowest"
+ level 2 - middle levels
+ level 1 - the inner levels - the "fastest"

**Recommendations:**

* This is just a suggestion how the levels of this kind can be used

+ A lot more combinations from 6 levels can be added but that is left to the discretion of anybody using the levels indicator

* You can use color changes as possible "signals"
