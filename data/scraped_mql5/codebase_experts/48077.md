* The indicator can calculate gain/loss in two modes: plain candlestick Close and Open difference, and as difference between current Close and previous Close.
* You can set minimum change limits (for pips and percentage), change modes, and you can also control font color of the output numbers. The indicator is available for MT4.
* **Displays the gains and losses for all candles where the given threshold is surpassed. The values are calculated in points and percentage.**

The Breakeven Point, or Titik Impas, denotes the price level at which a trade's profit becomes zero. By setting a position to Titik Impas Breakeven, the stop-loss is aligned with the position's opening price. This strategy proves valuable when you aim to allow profits to accumulate while ensuring that the trade remains secure and does not revert to negative territory.
