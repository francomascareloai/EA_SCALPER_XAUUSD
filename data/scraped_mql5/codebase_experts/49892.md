There is no picture in the description, which is in the header of this discussion.

If you use structures (and macros) in the source, the code will become more concise (and logical), the error probability will decrease and the speed of code modifications will increase.

For some reason KodoBase was able to compile the mq5 file.

Thank you for your interest.

Kodobase has everything to make the mq5 file compile.

The code is not perfect for pros like you, but it is the best of mine that I can show others.

It will not work if the master and slave brokers are not the same. Also, the suffix and prefix values ​​have no effect.
