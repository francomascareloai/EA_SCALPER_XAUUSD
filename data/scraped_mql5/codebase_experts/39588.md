Arrow Up and Down on each bar and informations about "power of trend" and about "PEAK" or "EXTREM peak" on the chart.

Indicator uses only WPR and RSI signals. Arrows can be changed only on last bar and indicator can be used on all TF and all symbols.  
Princip is simle ((WPR(4) +100 + RSI(2))/2) < or > 50. This is my first indicator, be carefull and good luck.

On chart are used another 4 indicators: BollingerBands (9,2,0), Clock, FiboPiv\_v2, PL4 CandleTime

I use this on all timeframes and really like it to know which direction the power and volume is going. I'm using Metatrader5 more and more. What would it take to convert the code to MT5?

This indicator shows market highs and lows for any timeframe with period separators.
You can see daily/weekly/monthly highs/lows on lower timeframes like H1/M30/M40. This is good for trading breakouts.
