An expert advisor designed to open and close respective orders at the
first parabolic SAR signal. Its performance depends on the custom
parameters of stop loss, take profit, trailing stop, lot size for
opening trades and more. **Note:** You
need to change the
SAR indicator "Step" and "maximum" value/s to that of the EA in order to
match the EA operation with that of the SAR indicator. But this is just
for visual purposes as the EA does'nt need the indicator in order to
work. e.g. if you are using the default step setting for the EA (0.001)
you might get a false impression that the EA didnt open an order when
the SAR indicator with its default step setting (0.02) showed a signal
but in reality the virtual SAR with a step setting of 0.001 had'nt yet
shown a signal. If no order
was opened and the journal displayed an error as to why, thats when
action needs to be taken. Always
check this page for updates thank you !!!. Ive also included a full documentation for pSAR bug 5 available [here](/go?link=http://fx.netspier.net/psarbugdoc.php "/go?link=http://fx.netspier.net/psarbugdoc.php")

**alexboyd:**  

great stats. however, why is your modelling quality n/a?

and can we see a backtest on the rest of 2010-2011? which would be walk-forward optimization...

  
You can do your own testing if you want more results. I give my EAs for free without charging for usage nor downloads so wether you use it or not it doesn't benefit me in anyway.

Is it possible to add EMA to this expert? It would place orders only in the direction of EMA

Hi there. I believe for 5 digit brokers you need to use a

```mql5
TakeProfit*StopMultd
```

Since that is in pips?

Hi,

I have compiled it, added to the "experts advisor" ; added to the chart also.

I am using a [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties").

It doesn't seem to do anything.

I am doing anything wrong? or have to do anything else to make it work? or is it that it won't work with a demo account?

thanks

suresh

This indicator relies on price action alone - does the price break a previous High or Low?
