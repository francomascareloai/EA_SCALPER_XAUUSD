Aroon indicator was developed by Tushar S. Chande, CEO of the "Tuscarora Capital Management" company and the author of the books ["The New Technical Trader: Boost Your Profit by Plugging into the Latest Indicators"](/go?link=https://www.amazon.com/New-Technical-Trader-Plugging-Indicators/dp/0471597805/ "http://www.amazon.com/New-Technical-Trader-Plugging-Indicators/dp/0471597805/") and ["Beyond Technical Analysis: How to Develop and Implement a Winning Trading System"](/go?link=https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Technical-Analysis-Develop-Implement/dp/0471415677/ "http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Technical-Analysis-Develop-Implement/dp/0471415677/") in 1995 to determine trend direction and strength.

Its main advantage is to allow a trader to determine the beginning of a new trend, or the end of an existing trend.

Aroon indicator can be calculated using the following equations:

Bullish indicator = [(N periods - N periods from the highest maximum / N periods] \* 100  
Bearish indicator = [(N periods - N periods from the lowest minimum) / N periods] \* 100

Both equations indicate recent maximums and minimums. Higher indicator values show more recent maximums and minimums, whereas lower values show less recent maximums and minimums. Besides, Aroon indicator values oscillate between levels 0 and 100 where a higher value indicates a stronger trend and vice versa.

Indicator moves around 30 and 70 key positions - movements higher than 70 indicate a strong trend, whereas movements lower than 30 indicate a weak trend.

Movements between 30 and 70 indicate that the market is unstable. For example, if the bullish indicator is higher than level 70, whereas the bearish indicator is lower than level 30, the trend is definitely upward. Intersections between bullish and bearish indicators indicate confirmations, if they occur between the levels 30 and 70. For example, if the bullish indicator intersects the bearish one upwards, a upward trend is confirmed.

Very similar to the simaphore indicator+bears-buul power, only with additional trend strength readings

Take a look at the example from [iCustom](/en/docs/function_indices) to see how an external indicator is called up and its values retrieved.

By the way, here is the list of all functions with a brief explanation (for a kind of keyword search with Ctrl+F): [https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/function\_indices](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/function_indices "https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/function_indices")

Dear Sergey,

Thank you for the indicator. I am trying to use it for my EA.

However, I get always the same values when I - for example - try to print the values.

The code is as follows:

// Handle and variables defined before!!!

aroonHandle = iCustom(\_Symbol, \_Period, "Market\\aroon", aroonPeriod, 0); // Adjust parameters as needed  
     
   if(aroonHandle == [INVALID\_HANDLE](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/otherconstants "MQL5 documentation: Other Constants"))  
   {  
      Print("Error initializing Aroon indicator!");  
      return;  
   }  
     
   for (int shift = 0; shift < 3; shift++)  
   {  
      // Get the Aroon values for the last three candles  
      double aroonUp = iCustom(\_Symbol, \_Period, "Market\\aroon", aroonPeriod, 0, shift);  
      double aroonDown = iCustom(\_Symbol, \_Period, "Market\\aroon", aroonPeriod, 1, shift);  
     
      // Print the values  
      Print("Candle", shift, " - Aroon Up:", aroonUp);  
      Print("Candle", shift, " - Aroon Down:", aroonDown);  
   }

**The values printed are always:**

Candle0 - Aroon up:          10.0  
Candle0 - Aroon down:     11.0  
Candle1 - Aroon up:          12.0  
Candle1 - Aroon down:     13.0  
Candle2 - Aroon up:          14.0  
Candle2 - Aroon down:     15.0

Even with other codes, the indicator always gives me these values back with iCustom.

What am I doing wrong?

Thank you in advance!
