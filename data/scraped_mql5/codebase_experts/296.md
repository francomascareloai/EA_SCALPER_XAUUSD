Simple script with demonstration of use of the [ChartNavigate()](/en/docs/chart_operations/chartnavigate) function.

The script uses several chart functions:

* [ChartID()](/en/docs/chart_operations/chartid) - to get the handle of the chart with the script launched (the handle is used in [chart operations](/en/docs/chart_operations))
* [ChartGetInteger()](/en/docs/chart_operations/chartgetinteger) - to get the number of the first visible bar on the chart ([indexing as timeseries](/en/docs/series/bufferdirection) is used - the last (uncompleted) bar has index 0),
* [ChartSetInteger()](/en/docs/chart_operations/chartsetinteger) - to set chart shift from the right border of the chart, to disable autoscroll when new tick, to set drawing as candles and showing of tick volumes.

Each navigation demo is commented using the [Comment()](/en/docs/common/comment) function.
