**Candle Range MetaTrader indicator** — is a very simple and lightweight indicator that displays the candle's range in pips on mouseover. In addition, to the High/Low range, it can optionally display the body size (Open/Close) for candles. Multiple display parameters are available to control how the indicator looks. This indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5 versions of the trading platform.

## Input parameters

* **ShowBodySize** (default = false) — if *true*, a candle's body size will also be shown.
* **HavePipettes** (default = false) — if *true*, the indicator will assume that the currency pair's quote contains pipettes and will show the pip ranges accordingly.
* **TrueRange** (default = false) — if *true*, the indicator will calculate true range (including the gap part) instead of the normal range.
* **font\_color** (default = clrLightGray) — the color of the candle range indicator.
* **font\_size** (default = 10) — the size of the candle range indicator.
* **font\_face** (default = "Verdana") — the font of the candle range indicator.
* **corner** (default = CORNER\_LEFT\_UPPER) — the location for the candle range indicator on the chart.
* **distance\_x** (default = 3) — the horizontal distance from the corner to the indicator.
* **distance\_y** (default = 12) — the vertical distance from the corner to the indicator.
* **DrawTextAsBackground** (default = false) — if *true*, the text label with the candle range value will be drawn as background. It can be useful if you want to prevent the indicator from obscuring the chart.
* **ObjectPrefix** (default = "CR-") — the prefix for chart objects for compatibility with other indicators.
