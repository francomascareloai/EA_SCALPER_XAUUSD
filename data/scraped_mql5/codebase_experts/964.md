### Description:

OpenBuyPosition script is developed for buying with fixed Stop Loss and Take Profit values in points from the current price. The main advantage of this script is its ability to fix a deal volume, which depends on the entire deposit size, using MM (Money Management) script input parameter. This script determines a ratio between the amount of funds involved in the deal and all the funds of the deposit.

### The script input parameters:

```mql5
//+----------------------------------------------+
//| SCRIPT INPUT PARAMETERS                      |
//+----------------------------------------------+
input double  MM=0.1;       // Money Management
input int  DEVIATION=10;    // Price deviation
input int  STOPLOSS=300;    // Stop Loss in points from the current price
input int  TAKEPROFIT=800;  // Take Profit in points from the current price
input uint RTOTAL=4;        // Number of repeats in case of unsuccessful deals
input uint SLEEPTIME=1;     // Pause duration between repeats in seconds
```

**nonor:**  
 yes, but in mt4, I have a script wich I call by keys, Alt+c, and then positions are closed, it a kind of emergency close...

Hi nonor,

Yep, I also have that in MT4 :D. However, MT4 is ticket based trading while MT5 is position base trading. I think close all can be applied in MT5 too, it just like I said before that's the way to close any open position in MT5 :(.

hi Nikolay

Was looking for a scrip like this great idea...tried using the scrip by attaching it to the chart but it immediately gets removed automatically fom the chart .

what do you think could be the problem

It didn't work for me so I got the debugger to find out that on my broker this was not working.  See the line I commented out?  Try that. Extrem\_Stop was always coming back zero - could be [a bug](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/628 "Get in touch with developers using Service Desk!").

```mql5
bool StopCorrect(string symbol,int &Stop)
  {
//----
   int Extrem_Stop=int(SymbolInfoInteger(symbol,SYMBOL_TRADE_STOPS_LEVEL));
   //if(!Extrem_Stop) return(false);
   if(Stop<Extrem_Stop) Stop=Extrem_Stop;
//----
   return(true);
  }
```

The orders are placed, but no StropLoss and Takeprofit are set.  I tryed to check the code, failing.

What's wrong in the code for not setting those [parameters](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/directx/dxinputset "MQL5 Documentation: DXInputSet function") ?

thanks
