The EA checks trading signals when a new bar appears:

* BUY:

+ RSI > **RSI Level Up**
+ CCI > **CCI Level Up**

* SELL:

+ RSI < **RSI Level Down**
+ CCI < **CCI Level Down**

If both signals (from RSI and CCI) are "true", then the signal is considered to be present and a position with the **Lots** volume is opened. **Stop Loss**, **Take Profit** and **Trailing Stop** can be disabled by setting the appropriate parameter to "0.0".

EURUSD, M15. Test result (optimization was performed from 2018.05 to 2018.08 - this part of the optimization is marked in the figure)

**Automated-Trading:**  

[Basic CCI RSI](/en/code/21976):

Author: [Vladimir Karputov](/en/users/barabashkakvn "barabashkakvn")

Vladimir, Greetings! Thank you for your work! Could you please add EMA to the Expert Advisor with the possibility to customize the period? The idea is to prohibit buying an instrument based on CCI+RSI signals if the EMA is above the chart and selling if the EMA is below it.

And I would also like to limit the total number of trades per bar or per number of bars, for example, 1 trade in 1 bar, 1 trade in 2 bars, 1 trade in 3 bars.

Thanks!

Couldn't beat importing a picture.

What is "period" in your understanding? Is it "indicator averaging period" or is it "timeframe"?

**ilya n [#](/ru/forum/273753#comment_27261779)**:

And also would limit the total number of trades per bar or per number of bars, for example 1deal in 1bar, 1deal in 2bars, 1deal in 3bars.

I will rewrite on the new trading engine and there is automatically a limit: on one bar no more than one BUY entry and no more than one SELL entry.

I will rewrite on a new trading engine and there is an automatic restriction: on one bar no more than one BUY entry and no more than one SELL entry.

**Indicator averaging, as in the standard setting.**

I will rewrite it on the new trading engine and there is an automatic restriction: on one bar no more than one BUY entry and no more than one SELL entry.

**Sorry, I checked by opening time - correct, one per bar. It's just that when there are several of them in minus, time is an endless torture. :)**

**Is it possible to make a line with a selection:**

**if we select unlimited number of deals (multi deals) - true,**

**and if we choose NOT unlimited number of trades (multi deals) - fouls, it means one trade, for example for 5-10 bars, until the next entry into the RSI+CCI signal zone.**

**Thank you very much, looking forward to it!!!**
