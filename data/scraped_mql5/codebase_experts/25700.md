The script exports summary of closed trades selected between two dates grouped by each trading day. The resulting file is CSV that can be opened/imported with any spreadsheet software.

To export summary for the entire trading history, keep **Start date** and **End date** at their default values.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/83/Capture__2.PNG)

The CSV file is located at: Terminal > File > Open data folder > MQL5\Files\<Filename>

The CSV file will be auto-opened with the associated Windows program (e.g., Microsoft Excel or Ron's CSV Editor).

Following data columns are exported for each trading day:

* **Date of the trading day**
* **Total trades**
* **Volumes**
* **Profits**
* **Swaps**
* **Commissions**
* **Net profits**

**![](https://c.mql5.com/18/83/Capture3.PNG)**

The CSV file can be opened with Microsoft Excel or better with  Ron's CSV Editor.

Thank you for this great advisors

Just if it is way to get the history deals with the orders that still opened?
