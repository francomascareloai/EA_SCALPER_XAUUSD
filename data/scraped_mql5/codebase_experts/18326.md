The EA trades based on the Fractals indicator. It only trades at the emergence of a new bar. Lot calculation: percentage of free margin. When an upward fractal is found, a Sell signal is generated and all Buy positions are closed. When a downward fractal is found, a Buy signal is generated and all Sell positions are closed.

For optimization purposes.

Two input parameters simplify configuration:

* ***Distance (in pips)***
* and ***Signal bar***

![Fractal minimum distance](https://c.mql5.com/18/59/USDJPYM15.png "Fractal minimum distance")

Fractals minimum distance. The "Distance" parameter

***Signal bar*** — bar number (relative to the current one) on which the fractal is checked.
