This is my 1st published code, it is very simple code example:

* RSI 14 (price close) — open buy when it is < 25
* RSI 14 (price close) — close buy when it is > 50
* RSI 14 (price close) — open sell when it is > 75
* RSI 14 (price close) — close sell when it is < 50

Includes trailing stop, fixed TP & fixed SL.

**Claude Beaudoin:**  

Hi Mohammad,

Thanks for the contribution, it's always nice to see other people's examples and how they code.

If I may, I would like to make a few comments for others (and perhaps yourself) in code efficiency.  I believe it's important to keep the OnTick() and start() functions as lean as possible when writing an EA.  For example, in your code example after taking a position when the RSI is below 25, you then check if the RSI is above 75 for a short position.  We know with 100% certainty that the conditions will never occur on the same tick, so we could exit the function once the order has been opened.  Also, once you've taken a position, you then re-select the order and modify the stop loss and [take profit](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders") with a call to OrderModify().  This could have been done at the same time you opened the order.  The new code would then look like this...

      if((iRSI(NULL,0,14,PRICE\_CLOSE,0)<25)) // Here is the open buy condition

There's also a potential bug in the next section of code where it's possible the order will be closed (either long or short) and then a call to OrderModify() if the user selects a tight value for TrailingStop.  The solution would be to place a 'return' when the order is closed.

Keep up the great work, looking forward to more of your code!

Cheers!

Thanks for your time

the written code by you above is similar of my code

the most important for the programmer to arrive the aim what ever the language or code...

with respect of your opinion

**yes I am planning to post more codes**

feel free to update the code as u wish and post the modification here

Dears all,

I am preparing a new code for a meta trader 4 EA

It is the same but on the [stochastic oscillator](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/50 "The Stochastic Oscillator compares where a security’s price closed relative to its price range over a given time period")  

Very soon will be published

This depends on the community admin
