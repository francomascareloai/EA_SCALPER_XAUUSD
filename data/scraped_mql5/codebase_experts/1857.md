When you drag this script onto the chart, it will calculate the price where you drop the script and use this price to figure out if a Buy Stop or Buy Limit pending order should be placed.

The stop loss is calculated from the Risk Percentage input. The take profit is then calculated using the stop loss and Reward Ratio.

It is a pretty simple script, so enjoy!

Why doesn't it work when I drag in the icon? I don't think it works with other scripts either.
