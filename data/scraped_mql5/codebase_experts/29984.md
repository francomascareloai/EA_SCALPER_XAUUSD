I used to suffer from unnecessary losses and/or cutting my profit short since I wasn't fast enough to modify my SL and/or TP. That is why I've wrote these scripts that will allow me to react fast when I must modify my Sl and/or TP especially when I have many open and/or pending trades. I know there are plenty of Metatraders who also suffer from this and that is why I would like to share these scripts with you, hopefully it will be beneficial.

Do not forget to send you comments as well as rate these scripts. Happy trading!

  

These 3 MQL5 scripts will help you to immediately react to your open positions and pending orders. Below is an example on how to modify the SL of 4 Buy limit orders in one step.

I think many people have not tried to use this script; I have been using the one for MT4 & it is very slow. This is blazing fast on MT5. I have even moved away from MT4 you can end not getting the price you want because MT4 servers seems to be slow. I use this script with combination of close all trades in MT5. I have tried to rate a 5 star for some reason my rating ended up being a 2 and have been trying to change it system won't allow me do alter it to a 5 star. Great work
