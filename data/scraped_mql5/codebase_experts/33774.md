**This class loads a licensing file by reading 256bit encrypted account data from a license file into an account array for the purpose of licensing.**

*The Class is initialised with a Filename, a Master Key and whether the file needs to be saved in the common folders or not.*

**Important Methods:**

> **m\_Write(string m\_Acc  = "", string m\_Server = "")** - Adds a a new account to the licensing file...

> *(we use this to make a simple script to add new accounts to the licence file. directly in Mt5 / Mt4)*

> **m\_LicenceFound(string m\_Acc="", string m\_Server="")** - Checks the array of accounts from the license file to see if there is a matching and returns a bool based on it.

And finally there are two public functions available for encrypting and decrypting strings using 256 bit encryption... (if needed by user)

The included sample script file creates a license file using above class.

The script will append new account licences to the specified file...

**NASDAQ\_Guru:**  
 Do you have steps on how to add the script to my MQL5 EA?

The 256bit encryption is a bit erratic the 64bit one is better...

but you can use it something like this

CLicence \*CEALicence;

    CEALicence = new CLicence(FileStr,KeyStr, true); // true if file must be placed in common folder...

    if(CEALicence.m\_Write(AccountStr, BrokerStr, expiry))

       {

[MessageBox](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/io_constants/messbconstants "MQL5 documentation: Constants of the MessageBox Dialog Window")("Licence Created for "+AccountStr+" "+BrokerStr,"Licence Created", MB\_OK);

       };

    delete CEALicence;

   }

This kind of thing is trivial to break. I recommend to never use such false protection.

   }

Thank you. I'm not too sure if I added it incorrectly but it returns an error on the script.

What method would you recommend Alain? I have added passwords in the past but my creation was easily bypassed and now I see it shared in common telegram channels.

hi there,

I use this one:

And it works for me contrary to Alain's recommendation, but Alain is yet to supply a better solution...
