**Grigori.S.B [#](/ru/forum/221828#comment_52708457):**  

I've laid it out exhaustively - any telepath would understand.

What's not to understand?

- When compiling, it gives errors.

- It fails on"extern".

--------

I found out on the forum - it's an old form from mt4.

You need to replace"extern" with " input" in the code.

compiled successfully.

----------

now the question remains - it doesn't show if "input parameters" - "Type of appearance" - "Follow the price".

When "As comment" and  "  In selected corner of the screen" parameters show normally.

Translated into Russian))) - It does not show next to the price. as a comment and in the corners of the window shows.
