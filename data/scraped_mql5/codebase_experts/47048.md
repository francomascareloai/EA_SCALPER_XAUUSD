There are 2 input parameters:

1. AtrMultiplier: The lines will have this\* the current Atr value distance from the moving averages.
2. Period: High and Low moving average, Atr period.

The basic idea is to have 6 lines: upper will be 2\*atrmultiplier\*atr +HighMA, second then atrmultiplier\*atr + HighMA... Very easy to understand,

If you change the period the lines remains in the same place, so I wonder what the [parameter period](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/check/period "MQL5 documentation: Period function") is for.

Yes, unfortunately the author "hard-coded" the period parameter.

Change the following lines ...

> ```mql5
> High = iMA(_Symbol,PERIOD_CURRENT,20,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_HIGH);
> Low = iMA(_Symbol,PERIOD_CURRENT,20,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_LOW);
> Atr = iATR(_Symbol,PERIOD_CURRENT,20);
> ```

... into this ...

> ```mql5
> High = iMA(_Symbol,PERIOD_CURRENT,period,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_HIGH);
> Low = iMA(_Symbol,PERIOD_CURRENT,period,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_LOW);
> Atr = iATR(_Symbol,PERIOD_CURRENT,period);
> ```

There are also a few other "quirks", but it is up to the author to fix them.

My apologies, I did hard code this parameter, thanks for giving feedback and notifying me of this error, it should be fixed by now.

was the original Rainbow indicator using ATR in the formula? eitherway, this is a very nice use of ATR here and the indicator is decent!
