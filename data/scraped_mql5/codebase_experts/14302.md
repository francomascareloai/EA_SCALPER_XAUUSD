**Vladimir Gribachev:**  
 Not badly done! Well done, good result

Hi Vladimir,

 I really like your Coin Flip great idea.

I have done many back tests on clean data EUR/USD 1 min, for accuracy. Best result is posted here.

Please I want to ask if you (or maybe Marc Boggs if you are interested) can change the code to make the Coin flip "not random" after a Loss, but rather buy sell buy sell buy sell etc etc.

As sometimes I have experienced up to 22 losses in a row , which is mathematically mind blowing considering the odds against it.

With buy sell buy sell etc I have calculated a max loss run of 7 or 8, which will increase survival chances and a better end result.

I would greatly appreciate your feed back and help on this as I am not a coder.

Sorry - period for my back test is Jan 31 2005 - Nov 28 2005. - So basically 10 months. Random choice - no reason for this period.

Trailing Stop [functions](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions") do not even work.

It should trade at every new candle.
