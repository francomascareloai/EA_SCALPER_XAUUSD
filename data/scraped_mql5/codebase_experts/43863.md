An implementation of the *Commodity Channel Index* using exponential moving averages, instead of simple moving averages as implemented by the its creator, *Donald Lambert*.

The code uses conditional compilation and will compile on both MQL4 and MQL5. Please note that all my *CodeBase* publications’ source code are now also available in “Public Projects” tab of *MetaEditor* under the name “FMIC”.
