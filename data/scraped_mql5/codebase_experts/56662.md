**Anatoliy Migachyov [#](/ru/forum/482382#comment_56062972):**  

that's understandable, but it's for a specific instrument.

So all instruments will have a trading history.

This way there will be a trading history for all instruments.

It's clear, but here it's specific to the one you're interested in.
