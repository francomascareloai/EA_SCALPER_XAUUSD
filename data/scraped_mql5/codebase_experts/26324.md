This Expert Advisor is based on a very popular but dangerous strategy which doubles the stakes after each loosing trade. Finally, if there is enough margin, it will reverse into the direction of the current price movement and will eventually close in profit, compensating for the entire loosing series.

This code can be used in both MetaTrader5 and MetaTrader4. **Just change the file extension from .mq5 to .mq4** and compile the file in MetaEditor.

This expert advisor is designed with **visual strategy builder -****Mission Automate. Code is generated automatically. More info:** [https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/4951](/en/articles/4951)

This EA is available as a template in a free demo version, so you can easily modify / customise it without programming.

[Bars and Rates Information Utility, displays how many bars there are in all timeframes for any user selected symbol, and shows the 'CopyRates' information availablity for any bar](/en/code/26316)

This utility is not a trading or market information utility. This will likely only interest those writing (or debugging) indicators using multiple timeframes and collecting information using Bars (or iBars) and CopyRates.
The utility creates a list showing the number of Bars reported by the "Bars" function and shows the success of CopyRates for any selected bar by displaying that bar's time from the collected data (or, it shows the error).

This utility is not a trading information utility. It will only have value for those getting information on the Number of Bars that have terminal data. This utility uses the functions SeriesIntegerInfo and CopyRates to obtain and display information about the availability of bar information from the terminal.
