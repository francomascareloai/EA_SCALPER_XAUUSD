**rplust:**  
BlueSkyThinking... Sorry David, seems I was barking up the wrong tree. Just hate people putting their names on anything which is not theirs. I had tested your Ea long time ago to entertain myself on a boring trading day. On backtesting it makes incredibly good profit while just waiting for a chance to erase the account...... I remember getting a streight line seeming to want to go north forever...and I thought if this could be maintained it would be a traders dream....lol

  
no problem!! thanks a lot for pointing this copycat out!!! ;)

I have back tested this EA and it is almost straight line when the grids are 5 pips (50points) and close all (Amount) for about 8~13 (a low target I know but yields very high +ve outcome). I had already de-Martingaled it by changing the mathpower from 2 to 1. It seems to not be able to forward test on my [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"). Would this be because the first grid pending order is too close to the price?

The [backtests](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article \"Testing trading strategies on real ticks\"") are impressive, but the robot does not place any real trade in the demo or live account.

Do you know what's wrong with the code?
