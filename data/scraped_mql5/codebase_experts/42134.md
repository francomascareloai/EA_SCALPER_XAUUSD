[![EASY TREND INDICATOR](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s4__1.png "EASY TREND INDICATOR")](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s4.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s4.png")

(You need use Heiken Ashi to see the graph or change the parameter ti put the graph in front of the indicators)

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s1__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s1.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s1.png")

So I choose a H1 PERIOD to have a strong trend, I write a histogramme whith appropriate colors, and I put the all in MTF to have a better view in M1 or M5 PERIOD

EASY -> Green = UpTrend // Orange = not defined  // Red = DownTrend

The Bollinger inverse is just a bollinger Band inicator whith lower-mode parameter for the upperBB line and upper-mode parameter for the lowerBB.

When a very fast Ma cross the upperBB, is probably a uptrend and when is crossing the lowerBB, is probably a downtrend.

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s2__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s2.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s2.png")

(bollinger inverse + MA  + Heiken Ashi)

So I choose a H1 PERIOD to have a strong trend, I write a histogramme whith appropriate colors, and I put the all in MTF to have a better view in M1 or M5 PERIOD

when MA > UPPERBB -> Grenn, MA < UPPER && MA > LOWERBB -> Oraange, MA < LOWERBB -> RED

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s3__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s3.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/106/s3.png")

(a-TENDANCE-H1-chart-window + Heiken Ashi)

and I put the histogram in a MaxMinBand channel.

So you have to ajust the parameters of BBinverse, period, deviation and shift, and the parameters of the fast MA

and the Time Frime .

I prefere

extern int TimeFrame=60;

//---- input parameters Bollinger-inverse

extern int ainpperiod = 10;

extern double ainpdeviation =1.25 ;

extern int ainpshift = 1;

//---- input parameters Ma

extern int aperiodma = 3;

extern int ashiftma = 0;

extern int amethodma = 3;

extern int apricema = 5;

//---- input parameters MaxMinChannel

extern int Band\_PeriodMM = 90;

extern int SiftMM = 1;

But please, let me know your let me know your parameters preferences .

How to get a display as shown in the most upper picture, seen on page [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/42134?](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/42134 "https://www.mql5.com/en/code/42134")

I got the most lower picture, but thats not so nice. I would like to get the picture seen here above.

Another matter: would it be possible to have one file of source code? Three new indicators in the indicator display is confusing if only one of them shall be used.
