### Indicator

The 'Ask' line is formed as the 'Close' price + the value from the '***spread***' array (we take the array from OnCalculate)

```mql5
int OnCalculate(const int rates_total,
                const int prev_calculated,
                const datetime &time[],
                const double &open[],
                const double &high[],
                const double &low[],
                const double &close[],
                const long &tick_volume[],
                const long &volume[],
                const int &spread[])
```
