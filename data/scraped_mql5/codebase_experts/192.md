# Smoothed Accelerator - indicator for MetaTrader 5

The indicator plots the smoothed value of the following experession:

Out[i]=MathLog(Close[i]/Close[i+ExtPeriodAcc]),

where ExtPeriodAcc is the accelerator period, defined by "Acc period" input parameter.

The smoothing is carried out by four-pass [EMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma) with period, specified in the "MA period" input parameter.

**Input parameters:**

* Acc period – accelerator period;
* MA period – averaging period;
* N History - number of bars to plot.

Let's make an experiment : Copy the original sequence of sufficient length into the working array. Smooth this data in the array, for example, using MA2. Change the indexing direction of our working array. Let's perform MA2 smoothing again As a result, we will get the smoothed original sequence located in our working array. The result of smoothing will correspond to the application of a zero-delay filter (symmetrical impulse response) except for the sequence edges where the edge effect or as it is called here, redrawing will appear. Above, MA, i.e. a filter with a finite impulse response, was used as an example. When using filters with infinite impulse response (e.g. EMA ), theoretically the edge effects will propagate over the entire length of the sequence. But if the smoothing factor is small enough, this feature can most often be neglected. If you cannot theoretically understand why this happens, perform an experiment, smoothing, for example, a single pulse located in the middle of the sequence, and make sure that there is no delay after filtering. By the way, instead of multi-pass algorithms you can apply smoothing once with a filter having a symmetric impulse response. The result will be the same. As it was already said, at counter-passes of smoothing, the filter delay is compensated, and it happens objectively and does not depend on how you treat it. PS It should be noted that edge effects (redrawing) are determined by the resulting impulse response of the filter and the shape of the original signal. In other words, the redrawing does not occur chaotically, but according to a strictly defined law, which allows you to use the redrawing indicator for making various kinds of decisions. If, of course, the algorithm of making these decisions is not too primitive.

good indicator, but it doesnt show up in some charts

Hello! The indicator is WANTED!) Just a question: Why doesn't the indicator work on the Dow index? On HQ and ES works great! But it doesn't work on Dow((( Help!

seyoh:

Works on Dow

Dear Victor,
I am trying your indicator and I have to say that it gives some insight in advance. Obivisly it is necessary to use them understanding the global context of the price action. Particularly it is interesting the inversion point of te indicators above all when there are, before and after them, steep slopes. But I have not understood the equation that you are using and why you are calling it acceleration. You have a division operation between two close prices ; my expectation was instead a double "derivate" with respect to the time something like
- V(i) = ( P(i) - P(i-n) ) / TF\*n, where P is price at the i-th candle n is period and TF the used timeframe - A(i) =  ( V(i) - V(i-n) ) / TF\*n
