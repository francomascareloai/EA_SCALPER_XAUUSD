* **Bollinger Indicator:**  
   Helps to identify market extremes. If the price goes beyond the bollinger lines given a certain threshold, an entry signal is generated.
* **Filter by Order Block:**  
   The Expert Advisor finds a support (for longs) or resistance (for shorts) range based on historical data (the number of bars is set by the OB\_Length  parameter  ). This helps to refine the signal and reduce false entries.
* **Self-learning mechanism:**  
   By analysing statistics (number of winning and losing trades), the TrendThreshold entry  threshold is dynamically  adjusted . Thus, the algorithm adapts to changing market conditions.
* **Risk Management:**  
   Stop Loss (SL) and Take Profit (TP) levels are calculated based on the difference between the entry price and the support/resistance level with an aggressive risk:profit ratio.
* **Project support:**  
   In the header of the Expert Advisor there is a link with the caption "Support the project, register!" leading to the[Bybit](/go?link=https://partner.bybit.com/b/forexmt5 "https://partner.bybit.com/b/forexmt5") page, which allows users to support the developer.
