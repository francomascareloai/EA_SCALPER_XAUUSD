**REMARK:** For this **to work perfectly**, you must have **high speed internet** and a **high quality Computer**. Otherwise, it will not work for you.

**INTRODUCTION :**

The currency strength meter is a trading tool that is used to identify trending and consolidating markets based on the percentage rate of change in price from one period to the next. 

Don't hesitate to send all your comments and I would appreciate rating this trading tool.

  

**HOW TO USE IT :**  
  
You can check the following video that will explain how to

* define and see how a currency strength meter works.
* use this trading tool to identify trending and consolidating markets (the most important part)
* compile this trading tool in MT4 or MT5.

You can also check the following video. It is about the Breakout Strength Meter

**cozyman:**  
 I wish I could test it, but for me it crashes the chart

Hey [@cozyman](/en/users/cozyman) no worry. You can try the script version of this trading tool. I already answered few guys about what you are saying.

"*You should know that in order for this to work, you have to have all the latest data of all 28 pairs. Therefore, when you first launch MT4, you don't have the latest data and when you run this indicator on your chart, the indicator will try to download all the latest required data of all 28 pairs, so it will take time to download them which is normal and sometimes even more time in case you have bad internet, or your computer is a low quality one. So yeah in this case it will crash, NOT because of the indicator, but because of your low cost computer or internet.*

*Remember, this trading tool and the breakout strength meter will get the latest data, so it works best for traders who can keep their MT4/MT5 open 24 hours not for those who just open their trading platform for couple of hours every day. Or you can switch back to the script version of this trading tool; I developed this version for those who can't afford running their trading platform 24/7*

*Hopefully this answer your concern.*"

Hey Michael, you can try the script version of this trading tool. I already answered few guys about what could cause you to have a blank charts. (check reply below)

hi.

This indicator works fine

As Rodi says:

First you must have 28 currency pairs and fast PC and connection

If you don't know how to use it don't commend

Fallow the steps in the video to set it up,but you must have a fast internet and good PC

Use daily chart

Thanks for the indicator
