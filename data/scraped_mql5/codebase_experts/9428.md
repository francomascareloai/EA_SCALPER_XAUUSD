Channel Zig Zag indicator, but how or why does it form a channel surrounding the ZZ lines? Are they [projected](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7863 "Article: Projects allow you to create profitable trading robots! But it is not exactly") areas where price may go? How may a ZZ indicator be used for a trade method or system when it repaints, people say repainting indicators can be used safely but never offer a way to show this with real trades or simulated.

**FXIA:**  

Channel Zig Zag indicator, but how or why does it form a channel surrounding the ZZ lines?

Not Zig Zag makes the channel but the channel processing makes Zig Zag. Have you tried to run it and to observe its behavior live? Or at least in visual mode?

Are they projected areas where price may go?

No, it's just a channel, but this channel is formed by price.

How may a ZZ indicator be used for a trade method or system when it repaints, people say repainting indicators can be used safely but never offer a way to show this with real trades or simulated.

Only the recent extremum repaints.

It also displays some statistics - the ratio between the length of the
section and that of the previous one, the length of the section (by
length we mean the height in points from the lowest to the highest
point).
