BTW, since you asked, I want it separate because I use it on M5 to help see 3 bar reversals and the indicator makes the bars harder to see, thanks again and happy trading

I've noticed that the lines have issues rendering sometimes when a new chart loads, or more commonly, when the Period / timeframe is changed.

For example:

I've been playing around with the code to see if I can find the issue, but I'm curious if anyone else have run into this or might know where to look first

without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later

[Strategy - Set And Forget (with Alerting system) - MT5](/en/code/31843)

This strategy is the well known set & forget with the ALERTING system. It is very useful on different trading scenarios. I urge you guys to always use trading tools that will make your live easier. So instead of watching the charts and the time and all day long, you can use this indicator that will watch the charts for you.
