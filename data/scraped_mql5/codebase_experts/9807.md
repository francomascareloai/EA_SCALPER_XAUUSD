* TakeProfit = 50, // size of skull cap in pips

Wrong, stop/take in Points. On a five digit broker a Point is NOT a pip. EA's should automatically adjust, users should not have to.

**WHRoeder:**  

* StopLoss = 50, // Size stop in pips
* TakeProfit = 50, // size of skull cap in pips

Wrong, stop/take in Points. On a five digit broker a Point is NOT a pip. EA's should automatically adjust, users should not have to.

Please show me a free ea on the internet, which does not lose all the money on [backtest](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article \"Testing trading strategies on real ticks\"") (enough in this year only), and which does not need any user's expertise. I have tried thousands of free experts, but no one of them worked really well on backtests. (Sorry for my beginner english, I am still learning it)

Thanks a lot!
