Script to determine whether your Broker follows the US, UK or AU daylight (DST) schedule.

The script scans the H1 chart bars of the current chart at the expected dates for the daylight changes, and by comparing the changes in server (bar) times at these bars, the DST schedule of your broker can be determined.

The algorithm is simple and fast. Additionally, it  works properly in the strategy tester because it does not depend on price reaction to economic calendar events (like other algos).

**DST\_AU schedule:**

* server dst begins on the first Sunday of October (+1) and ends on the first Sunday of April (-1)

**DST\_UK schedule:**

* server dst begins on the last Sunday of March (+1) and ends on the last Sunday of October (-1)
* source: [https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/uk/london](/go?link=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/uk/london "https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/uk/london")

**DST\_US schedule:**

* server dst begins on the second Sunday of March (+1) and ends on the first Sunday of November (-1)
* source: [https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/usa/new-york](/go?link=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/usa/new-york "https://www.timeanddate.com/time/change/usa/new-york")

**DST\_NONE schedule:**

* the server does not forward its clock during summer.

Sample outputs after running the script on different Fx brokers:

```mql5
/*
 Server : Exness-MT5Trial
 Time   : 2024.03.13 12:25:13
 Offset : GMT+0
 DST_NONE
*/
```

another broker:

```mql5
/*
 Server : OctaFX-Demo
 Time   : 2024.03.14 00:27:05
 Offset : GMT+2
 DST_UK : server dst begins on the last Sunday of March (+1) and ends on the last Sunday of October (-1)
*/
```

a third broker:

```mql5
/*
 Server : ICMarketsSC-Demo
 Time   : 2024.03.14 01:42:54
 Offset : GMT+3
 DST_US : server dst begins on the second Sunday of March (+1) and ends on the first Sunday of November (-1)
*/
```

My guess is that your broker is feeding the quotes from a different source every some months, that is why no ordered pattern can be identified. I think no other way except the feedback from their customer service.,   

Edit: this broker does not provide detailed info on their DST that I can program in the code.

This was very educational for my future broker time related development operations both in terms of MQL5 and broker time conventions

Am testing the script on the server "Exness-MT5Real9" and yesterday(9th March 2025), the US forwarded clocks for DST but the Exness MT5 platform time remained the same(GMT+0). I though the script would return DST\_NONE however I got DST\_US, am I missing something here?
