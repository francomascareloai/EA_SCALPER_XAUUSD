The EA unloads historical data in the \*.csv format for several timeframes of the symbol it is attached to, and updates these data with the preset periodicity (by default, once a minute).

The Ea doesn't trade. It will be helpful for those performing main analysis in separate programs and wanting to analyze quotes for his or her specific Data Center.

It is very convenient to attach the EA to several symbols simultaneously and to get fresh data in the \*.csv format once a minute.

The EA creates its directory Terminal\_dir\experts\files\Export\_History. The data are unloaded to this directory.
