The indicator shows the correlation of two currency pairs. It implements several approaches, which I found the most interesting.

Indicator settings:

* ***SecSymbol*** - the second symbol by which the correlation is built;
* ***Type*** - correlation type
* ***iPeriod*** - indicator period.

This indicator is designed for traders trading on several currency pairs. It allows you to evaluate the divergence-convergence of two symbols. And on the basis of this divergence you can make trading decisions.

[Similarity Based Market Watch Symbol Mapping Script](/en/code/54553)

This script is a reference solution for mapping symbol names configured by users in MetaTrader 5 EAs or scripts to the actual names provided by the broker.
It uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm to automatically identify the most similar symbol in Market Watch.
Ideal for developers facing compatibility issues with prefixes or suffixes in symbol names.
It is a customisable starting point to suit any specific need.
