The script allows to quickly remove indicators from charts. It has two operating modes:

* **ONLY\_THIS\_CHART** - only delete from the current chart (used by default);
* **ALL\_CHARTS** - delete from the current chart and all other charts opened in the trading platform.

**Note**: before using this scripts, it is may be sometimes useful to run the [SD W indicators and charts](/en/market/product/19786 "SD W indicators and charts") script, which displays information about all running indicators in the Experts tab. This can prevent you from removing useful information before you save necessary combinations and manual settings of running indicators.

**Artyom Trishkin:**  
 If the question is for Dina, she is sadly no longer with us.

That's too bad. - Can you tell me if it's possible to implement this in a script?

Great utility.

Do you have something similar to remove Experts from a script if possible?

I cannot use ExpertRemove()  [ExpertRemove - Common Functions - MQL5 Reference - Reference on algorithmic/automated trading language for MetaTrader 5](/en/docs/common/expertremove) in a script...

Thank you
