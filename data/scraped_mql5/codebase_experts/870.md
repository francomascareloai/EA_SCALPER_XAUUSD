**Description****:**

The Expert Advisor shows the application of [LibCustomChart.ex5](/en/market/product/196) library. The presence of iCustomChart custom chart is checked when attaching the Expert Advisor to a chart window. In case a custom chart has been uploaded, the library functions use the data of that chart. Otherwise, the data of a standard chart is used. Therefore, the Expert Advisor can work both with custom and standard charts without the need for any changes.

**Instructions**:

1. Download [LibCustomChart.ex5](/en/market/product/196) library file and place it to the **terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Libraries**
2. Download the file containing the library functions description LibCustomChart.mqh and place it to the **terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Include**
3. Download the Example1\_LibCustomChart.mq5 Expert Advisor file and place it to the **terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Experts**
4. Download Example1\_LibCustomChart.mq5 to MetaEditor and compile (**F7**)
5. Example1\_LibCustomChart.ex5 Expert Advisor can be launched both on a standard and custom chart created with the use of [iCustomChart](/en/market/product/186).
6. The following steps must be executed to upload the Expert Advisor on a custom chart:

* download [demo](/en/market/product/203) or [full](/en/market/product/186) version of iCustomChart and attach it to any chart window;
* then attach Example1\_LibCustomChart to the same window. It will automatically detect the presence of iCustomChart and get calculation data from it.

The idea is 5+!

If the implementation is not lame, I judge this event to be a success.

Thank you. Alpha testing was quite formidable and long. The engine was tested at the 2010 and 2011 championships in multi-currency mode. My first post on this topic was about a year ago. I'll find it... It's right [here](/ru/forum/3115#comment_53436). There was no beta testing. Well, so far in this version I have disabled the work in the tester. There is enough work on this idea. If you're interested, I'll gradually put it into operation.

This Indicator is used for calculating trend.

The indicator shows the use of the free Library for Custom Chart library for the automatic connection of the indicators to iCustomChart custom charts created on the basis of custom history files.

The indicator creates a channel and provides the possibility to configure it with automatic tuning.
