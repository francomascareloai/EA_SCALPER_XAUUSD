This one was first published some 5 years ago. But due to the changes of mt5, some features of it are not working as they used to work at that time (the volume factor - ie: the hot) is not working in the old versions any more

This version is using all the newest modes for metatrader 5 and is calculating all correctly (at least for the current builds of metatrader 5 😊). I believe that no parameter needs further explanation (they are self explanatory, the usual way)

**Recommendations:**

* You can use color changes as signals

Thank you for the detailed explanation and sample code!

On the MT5 "Indicator" tester, I compared the performance values ​​with a few reference indicators in the "[every tick](/en/articles/239 "Article: The Fundamentals of Testing in MetaTrader 5 ")" mode, and I can say that this version has "more acceptable" perfonmance results than the previous generation T3 family.

In the EA design I'm working on, I might consider giving T3 another chance with this release :)

If 'T3 volume factor' is 1.01 and greater, all plots go off the scale. Is it ok?
