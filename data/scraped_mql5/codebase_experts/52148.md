The code is an Expert Advisor for MetaTrader 5 based on a neural network. It uses historical market data to predict future price movements. The neural network has a hidden layer and adjusts its weights during training. There is a dynamic stop loss calculated with the ATR indicator. The EA has protection mechanisms against excessive losses, such as daily and total loss limits. The net parameters can be saved and reloaded later to continue training.

After downloading the neurobook and the sources, I would like to know if a version entirely in Python exists? The version provided poses a problem and I think especially if the openCl executions cannot be done on the machine. I am currently trying a conversion, but it is a bit titanic!  
 Best regards to anyone who has already undertaken such work, or who knows where to find the sources for a Python version.

Every time I get this in log file: ***No saved [neural network](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/497 "Article: Neural networks - from theory to practice ") parameters found. Starting fresh.***   What can be reason for this?

I've not run it yet, but according to the code you'd have to train the neural network in the strategy tester before putting it on a live chart. Have you done that?
