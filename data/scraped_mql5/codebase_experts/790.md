In trading systems, based on the channel breakout, the long position is opened when the price shows new X days maximum, and short position is opened when the price forms new X day minimum. It allows to forecast the trend direction. But there is a problem - very often trend detected with a lag and the most of the profit is lost.

The [HighestLowestRange (HLR)](/en/code/791) indicator helps to resolve the market entry problem before the channel breakout. The MPC indicator plots a simple channel using extermums of the specified period. It can be used for additional visual control of trading system (channel breakout), based on [HighestLowestRange (HLR)](/en/code/791) indicator

This indicator was first implemented in MQL4 and published in [Code Base at mql4.com](https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/11205) 25.01.2007.
