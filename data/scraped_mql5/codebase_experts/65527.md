Lightweight, open-source CVD indicator for MetaTrader 5. It visualizes net buying vs selling pressure as CVD candles in a separate window — a simple start for volume and order flow analysis.

## What it does

* Computes and plots CVD on your chart using M1 data (free version)
* Optional reset on timeframe boundaries (or never reset)
* Works on any symbol and timeframe

## How it’s calculated (free version)

* For each M1 candle: direction = sign(close − open)
* Volume delta = direction × tick\_volume
* CVD = cumulative sum of volume deltas
* Plotted as candles (open/close = previous/current CVD)

## Inputs

* InpResetPeriod (ENUM\_TIMEFRAMES): timeframe to reset CVD (e.g., H1, D1)
* InpNoReset (bool): set true to never reset

## Install

1. Copy CVD\_MT5\_v3\_m1\_codebase.mq5 to: MQL5/Indicators
2. Compile in MetaEditor (F7) or restart MetaTrader 5
3. Attach from Navigator → Indicators

## Tips & troubleshooting

* First run may need MT5 to download M1 history. Be patient; scrolling the chart or changing timeframe can help MT5 fetch data.
* If CVD doesn’t update, ensure your symbol/timeframe has M1 history available.
* For slow terminals, try less busy symbols or fewer open charts.
