Trading system based on [NRTR\_extr](/en/code/15244) indicator signals. A signal is formed at the close of a bar if a large colored dot of the indicator has appeared.

The Expert Advisor uses the compiled indicator file NRTR\_extr.ex5 for operation. Save it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
