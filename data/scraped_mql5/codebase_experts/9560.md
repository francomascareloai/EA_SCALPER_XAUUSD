me.

Basis of the script is the period\_converter by Metaquotes. Most of the work has been done by them, so thank these guys.

Automatically converts M1-data to M5/M15/M30/H1/H4/D1 in a single run, then it stops. No more guessing whether the script is finished or not.

Usage:

1. Delete all \*hst.files  
2. Import your M1-data via History Center

Thank you Schnappi for the Script, this saves some frustrating waiting and [checking](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function").

for those who wants week and month, just add the 2 lower lines into the code.

```mql5
   writeHistory(PERIOD_M5);
   writeHistory(PERIOD_M15);
   writeHistory(PERIOD_M30);
   writeHistory(PERIOD_H1);
   writeHistory(PERIOD_H4);
   writeHistory(PERIOD_D1);
   writeHistory(PERIOD_W1);     // added week
   writeHistory(PERIOD_MN1);    // added month
```

Although I like the idea of automation, this script seemed to take 12 hours to process 1 year's worth of 1M data.  As the data I have is 30 year's worth, I thought leaving it to run for an estimated 15 days was a little excessive!

So I used the period\_converter script which ships with MT4, and did the job manually.  Took me about 1/2 an hour to create all time frames, i.e., 1M 5M 15M 30M 60M 240M 1440M and 10080M.
