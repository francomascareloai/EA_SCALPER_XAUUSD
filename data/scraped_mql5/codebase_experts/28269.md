**Power of XXX indicator description.**

The indicator is showing relative actual strength of currency XXX.

The indicator calculates its value of close prices of 7 pairs containing currency XXX.

The indicator can be used for MEAN REVERSION based strategies.

Lets assume XXX YYY currency pair scheme where XXX is BASE currency and YYY is QUOTEcurrency.

Place Power of XXX into your chart first and Power of YYY second.

You can have 2 relevant situations.

1. Indicators curves are close to each other. It means there is higher probability that the price of the pair XXX YYY will go **UP**.

   Do not take Power of .. signals separately from overall market situation (SR levels/zones and so on).

![UP](https://c.mql5.com/18/89/BASE_vs_QUOTE_currency_Power_of_UP.png "UP")

2. Indicators curves are FAR from each other. It means there is higher probability that the price of the pair XXX YYY will go **DOWN**.

   Do not take Power of .. signals separately from overall market situation (SR levels/zones and so on).

![DOWN](https://c.mql5.com/18/89/BASE_vs_QUOTE_currency_Power_of_DOWN.png "DOWN")

Thank you, am grateful to you for contributing your Power of...  indicator as well as your sage advice on judging support and resistance levels.

Here you are using [USD/CAD pair](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/usdcad "USDCAD chart: techical analysis") which implies the Power of Aud can be used on other pairs too!!!

Best
graph time would be the D1?

Hi,

I am not sure. Possibly it can work on any TF or you can combine more Tf together.

Be so kind to take into consideration that the indicator can give you one information about of price.

Simply the price is in extreme not only on particular price pair for instance [AUDJPY](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/audjpy "AUDJPY chart: technical analysis") but also on AUDXXX.

One way to use the indicator is to combine it with SR level.

In terms of TF you can try to take information about longer extreme from longer TF such as D1 and than search for extremes on shorter TF such as H1.

Regards.

Jan.
