Counting the number of series of bullish and bearish bars. Displaying the result as a chart. Saving the screenshot of the resulting chart. The script uses the [CGraphic](/en/docs/standardlibrary/graphics/cgraphic "MQL5 Reference → Standard Library → Scientific Charts → CGraphic") class.

### Input Parameters

* **Count of bars** - the number of bars (from the rightmost bar on the chart), for which the calculation will be preformed;
* **Verification** - the flag for printing the copied timeseries of this symbol and the resulting array of bar series. NOTE: should only be enabled if the **Count of bars** parameter does not exceed 15-30. Otherwise the amount of printed data will be very large;
* **Save screenShot** - enable/disable saving of screenshots of the resulting chart;
* **Sleep (milliseconds)** - a delay in displaying the resulting chart.

Series of bars are coded according to the following principle:

```mql5
   enum ENUM_SERIES_TYPE
     {
      Bull=1,  // ↑
      Bear=-1, // ↓
     };
```

A "bullish" candlestick has the code of "1", a "bearish" candlestick has the code of "-1".

Another parameter for the name of the series is calculated as follows:

```mql5
current series (ENUM_SERIES_TYPE) * the umber of bars in a row in this series

int name_series=current_series_type*count_series;

```

Note: the very last series is not included in calculations, because you cannot know how long the series will last.

Screenshots are saved (if **Save screenShot** is enabled) to [data folder]\MQL5\Files\Statistics of candles\. An example of a saved screenshots of the resulting charts. Series are drawn along the X axis, i.e. the "-5" series means five bearish bars in a row, and "2" means two bullish bars in a row:

Not a bad script. I would only modernise it - the Y-axis is not the [number of bars](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/series/bars "MQL5 documentation: Bars function"), but the **percentage of the total number of processed bars**.

It would be more informative and it would be possible to compare different TFs and different instruments.
