This library is fully functional and bug free. A few years ago I thoroughly revised this library. Exactly  2021, ensuring its reliability. I recommend reading the author's original explanation for this library at the following   [LINK](/en/code/17472).

In this example, you will see complete and operational project, labeled "Example EA". This project uses a template obtained from the codebase, which is freely available. I made several modifications, added new features and more. Even though I've been away from this robot for a while now, that doesn't mean it lacks potential. With some fine-tuning and the addition of new features and functionality, it could be the promised robot. However, its current main role is to show how I have integrated this library.

Note:  <TradeAlgorithms.mqh>,  has been integrated into this example and has undergone the necessary improvements.

My fault, sorry. I forgot to mention that **>>** SmoothAlgorithms.mqh **<<** and **>>** TradeAlgorithms.mqh **<<**  must be placed in the **Include** folder, and all indicators must be placed inside the **Indicators** folder , >> Example EA<<  inside **Experts** folder.

This is one of my old [project](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7863 "Article: Projects allow you to create profitable trading robots! But it is not exactly") back to 2021

Amazing work, thank you for sharing!

I'm working my way through the EA [ExampleEA.mq5](/en/code/download/46816/exampleea.mq5 "ExampleEA.mq5") and most probably found a small bug. Could you turn your attention to function Breakeven() ?

Line 1141 says for POSITION\_TYPE\_BUY:

```mql5
if(Ex_m_breakeven_stop >= stop_level && (take_profit - bid >= stop_level || take_profit == 0.0))
```

Line 1164 says for POSITION\_TYPE\_SELL:

```mql5
if(Ex_m_breakeven_stop >= stop_level && ask - take_profit >= stop_level)
```

Both logic expressions obviously should be symmetric in my opinion. I guess the first one for long positions is correct?

EDIT: there's the same issue in function Trailing() ...

Hello, there may be some ambiguity within the mentioned functions, but this is just an example of a robot whose purpose is to demonstrate the implementation of the Smooth Algorithm class, nothing else.

The default CCI in MT5 doesn't have the shift parameter. This script implements the shift.
