This is a helper indicator which allows you to adjust vertical scale of a subwindow interactively (using keys), which is useful for zooming in and zooming out graphs of your favourite indicator placed in the same subwindow.

SubScaler allows you to view graphs with larger level of detail, when some enormous candles force the terminal to squeeze the overall picture along the vertical axis. This is a rare problem, but if it occurs, MetaTrader does not provide a built-in mechanism to zoom in/out ad hoc.

SubScaler does not have buffers and displays nothing on its own.

SubScaler must be the 1-st indicator in the subwindow, that is it's added to the main window and initiates new subwindow creation. Your indicator (whose scale should be controlled by SubScaler) must be the next one, that is it's dropped to the empty subwindow with SubScaler.

**It's required to enable 'Inherit scale' option for your indicator!**

!["Inherit scale" option in MetaTrader 5 indicator](https://c.mql5.com/18/96/InheritScale.png "\"Inherit scale\" option in MetaTrader 5 indicator")

The example above demonstrates the option for standard Volumes indicator, but it works in the same way for others, including custom indicators.

When both indicators are applied to a subwindow, use Up/Down arrow keys to scale up/down; hold Shift with the arrow keys to move up/down.

![SubScaler indicator in action](https://c.mql5.com/18/96/subscaler5.gif "SubScaler indicator in action")

Scaling up means that picture becomes larger (zoom in, can be clipped), whereas scaling down means that picture becomes smaller (zoom out).

The chart must have keyboard focus for the keys to take effect.

**Input parameters**

* Initial Maximum - upper bound of the data range at primary placement on a chart, +1000 by default;
* Initial Minimum - lower bound of the data range at primary placement on a chart , -1000 by default;
* Scale Factor - the step for the scale increase/decrease [0.01 ... 0.5], 0.1 by default;

When a chart is restored at the terminal start-up or from a loaded template, the SubScaler picks up the scale from the previous state.

Brilliant indicator, works PERFECTLY, just what I needed! Thanks a lot  
  
It is unbelievable that metatrader does  not have such basic functionality like this out of the box.

Don´t you know how to compile indicators in metaeditor?  
  
Open the SubScaler.mq5 in MT5 metaeditor  
  
Compile the code, it is gonna create a SubScaler**.ex5** file, put this file on MT5 indicator folder (access in MT5 by going File>Open Data Folder)  
  
Restart MT5 or right click on the indicator list and click "Refresh"

A special version of SubScaler supports new feature: multiple SubScaler's instances in different subwindows and indicators.

Switch On/Off of scaling and shifting the curves in specific subwindow by clicking the lever object of SubScaler - by default it's shown in the upper right corner of subwindow.

Only one instance of SubScaler is active in the chart.

![2 instances of SubScalerM in subwindows of the same chart](https://c.mql5.com/3/408/SubScalerM.png "2 instances of SubScalerM in subwindows of the same chart")

If you remove an active SubScaler subwindow from the chart, you'll need to click/enable any other one of remaining SubScalers to make it work.

Important: place every SubScaler instance and add its controllable indicator together (just one after another); do not place many instances of SubScaler beforehand, because this way MT5 creates empty subwindows which are not counted by the platform and hence every SubScaler instance will not distinguish its subwindow index from the others. As alternative you can specify custom SubScaler name in the input variable SubWindowName.
