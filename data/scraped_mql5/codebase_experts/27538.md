Use some other indicator

Among other things, in :

```mql5
   for(int i=rates_total-prev_calculated-1; i>0; i--)
```

rates\_total-prev\_calculated-1 will result in -1 (ie: no calculation) for every new tick

You are getting empty value for
all those new bars that were skipped to be calculated

**Luc Levesque:**  

I try to read [indicator
buffers](/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/lines "MQL5 documentation: Indicators Lines") using iCustom .

But it returns EMPTY VALUE (214753....)

Problem resolved, please download the code again and try it again

**Seyed Hadi Ghoreishimedyseh:**  

[Moving average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "MetaTrader 5 Help: Moving Average indicator") counts the price of the last 14 RSI candles I've seen in some places  traders look for this indicator.

 Using this indicator depends on your strategy.

Thanks for your work. Long time I used RSI+MA10 manually on F&O Trading. But I could not overlap MA with RSI in MT4 / MT5 Platform. What is the use of two MAs. Can you please clarify. I Hope one MA is enough as crossover with RSI.
