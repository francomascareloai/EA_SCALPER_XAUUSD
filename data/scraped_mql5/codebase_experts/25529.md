This expert is a tool to check broker execution and spread.

Attach expert in any chart and wait to finish check.

Expert sends a pending order (Buy Stop) away from the current price (100 pips) and then modifies it.

When expert is removed from chart, pending orders expire and are deleted after 15 minutes.
