Hi Mr. Dalali,

i like your MultiCurrency Template Mt5. I want you set strategy in Ea which depend on Daily Close Change 0.50% plus or minus. Open buy order if changed price in Plus and Sell if in Minus. You can set two difference symbol for One Buy and One Sell. First order depend on one main symbol E.g. Gbp-Usd and Second after one order placed. When first order open on Gbp-Usd either Buy Or Sell Second order auto place by Ea in Opposite direction on Second currency Eg. Eur-Usd. [Take profits](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7113 "Article: Scratching Profits to the Last Pip ") should be 100 Points net on basic lot size. Please try this strategy hedge strategy and check result may me in positive.

The code defines a function "RangeHighs" that calculates the highest price of a financial instrument within a specified time range (start and end time). The time range is defined by 4 input parameters (hour and minute of start and end time). The highest price is found using the "CopyHigh" function and stored in an array, from which the maximum value is returned.
