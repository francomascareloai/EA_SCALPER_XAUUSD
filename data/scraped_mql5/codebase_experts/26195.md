The utility will display the high, low, open, close and time statistics for any user selected bar of any timeframe for the symbol of the chart
the utility resides on.  The indicator posts an event (EventChartCustom) to process its data collection and display activities,
keeping the processing time for those activities outside of the indicator's quote (OnCalculate) processing times.

The Indicator also highlights the bar for which statistics are being displayed - this shows the highlight of an H4 bar on an M30 chart:

![Highlight of the H4 bar on a M30 chart](https://c.mql5.com/18/84/SingleBarValues_BarHighlight.PNG "Highlight of the H4 bar on a M30 chart")

When the timeframe of the bar is less than the timeframe of the chart (or the same as the chart), this highlight can be difficult to discern.
