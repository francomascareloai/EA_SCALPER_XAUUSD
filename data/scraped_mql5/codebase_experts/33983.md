When the close of the candle is above the indicator line, then the stock is in an uptrend, when below, then the stock is in a downtrend. Buy when the indicator line is green and sell when it is red. The version for MetaTrader 4 will not be presented here. You can download it along with the source code through my Telegram channel. The link to the channel is in my [profile](/en/users/andreifx60).
