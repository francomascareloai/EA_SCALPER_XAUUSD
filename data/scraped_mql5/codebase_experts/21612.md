The trading system based on the [Wajdyss\_Ichimoku\_Candle](/en/code/21594 "Wajdyss_Ichimoku_Candle - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator signals with an ability to change the volume of a forthcoming trade depending on the results of the previous trades for this trading system. Trading signals are formed when a bar closes if a trend has changed (which is displayed by candles changing their color).

The block of input EA variables is added for managing volumes of opened positions:

```mql5
input uint    BuyLossMMTriger=2;  // Number of loss-making Buy trades to decrease MM
input uint    SellLossMMTriger=2; // Number of loss-making Sell trades to decrease MM
input double  SmallMM_=0.01;      // Share of financial resources from the deposit used in a trade in case of losses
input double  MM=0.1;             // Share of financial resources from the deposit used in a trade in case of normal trading
input MarginMode MMMode=LOT;      // Lot size calculation method
```

In case of such inputs and if the last two trades in one direction were loss-making, the EA opens the next trade in the same direction having the volume of 0.01 lot. If at least one of the two last trades is not loss-making, the position volume is 0.1.

For the generated EA to operate correctly, the compiled **wajdyss\_Ichimoku\_Candle.ex5** indicator file should be in the **<terminal\_data\_directory>\MQL5\Indicators** folder.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters with stops have been used during tests shown below.
