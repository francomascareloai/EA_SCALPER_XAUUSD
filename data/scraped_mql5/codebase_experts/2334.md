A trading system that uses the [DynamicRS\_C](/en/code/2329) indicator.

A trade decision is made when the direction of the indicator movement changes.

For a correct operation of the EA, place the compiled indicator file Exp\_DynamicRS\_C.ex5 to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
