[Trend Vision MT4 Indicator](/en/code/64055)

Trend Vision is a custom MT4 indicator that combines MACD momentum with Bollinger Bands volatility to give clear, reliable trading signals.
MACD shows momentum shifts, divergence, and trend strength.
Bollinger Bands measure volatility, expansion, and squeezes.
By fusing these two, Trend Vision filters out false moves and highlights only the high-probability moments when both momentum and volatility agree.

![MA Cross Alert MT4 Indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)

MA Cross Alert is a custom MT4 indicator that solves one key problem: MetaTrader’s built-in Moving Average shows the line but has no way to alert you when price crosses it.

[Dollar Index Tracker - See the Dollar Index right below your chart.](/en/code/64246)

Dollar Index Tracker displays the US Dollar Index (USDX / DXY) directly below the chart of your current trading pair. This makes it easy to compare the strength of the US Dollar against a basket of major currencies while analyzing your pair at the same time.

![Trade By Retail Sentiment](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Trade By Retail Sentiment](/en/code/62627)

This Expert Advisor uses retail trader sentiment from the Ziwox API to implement a contrarian trading strategy, taking trades opposite to the majority of retail positions. By combining sentiment data with a moving average trend filter, it identifies potential market reversals and avoids crowded trades. The EA automatically fetches and parses sentiment in real-time, executes buy or sell orders based on contrarian logic, and displays clear visual indicators of retail long and short ratios directly on the chart, providing traders with both actionable signals and market insight.
