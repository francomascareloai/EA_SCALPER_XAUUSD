The Expert Advisor looks for a negative spread and trades using it. The EA waits until Ask is less than Bid, then opens Sell and closes the position immediately.

I heard that negative spread appears very rarely, please write in the comments if you encounter one. People on the forums recommend trading stocks of Google, Amazon and other big companies.

**Alexandr Murzin:**  

Is there such a thing?

Can't you do the same for MT4?

Why do you need MT4 - there are only kitchens there.

**Alexander Pavlov:**  

Google "Negative spread" and everything will become clear.

They write that it is often found on shares.

And search here too - someone wrote about a brokerage centre that regularly shows a negative spread.

By the way, kitchens on the contrary struggle with it.

There is only one DC with its own terminal. And there is nothing for MT. Can anyone tell me? Such a [grail](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/5008 "Article: Reversal - holy grail or dangerous delusion? ") is idle.

**Alexandr Murzin:**  
 Нашёлся только один ДЦ со своим терминалом. А для МТ ничего нет. Может кто подскажет ? А то такой грааль простаивает.

My EA worked yesterday (only I didn't have enough money). The forex platform (not FORTS will probably be better).[![](https://c.mql5.com/3/75/Spr__1.PNG)](https://c.mql5.com/3/75/Spr.PNG "https://c.mql5.com/3/75/Spr.PNG")

**Alexander Pavlov:**

Can the demo be trusted? In the specification, the minimum spread for this instrument is 5 pips.

In a [real account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 Documentation: Account Information"), it's like a black spread.
