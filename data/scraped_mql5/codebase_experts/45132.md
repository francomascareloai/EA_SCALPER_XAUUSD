The basic idea behind the indicator is to check for bouncebacks between support and resistance levels. There are two input parameters: period and overlook. A support level is the lowest low in the last period bars if this value is equal to the lowest low of the last period+overlook bars. A resistance level is the highest high in the last period bars if it is equal to the highest high of the last period+overlook bars. If there are both support and resistance levels and a bounceback happens (price is between these levels) the support and resistance levels will be displayed on the chart.

In the original Indicator the i integer runs from period+overlook until rates\_total, so the for cycle is for(i = rates\_total-3;i<rates\_total;i++). But for some reason I had to change that to validate my code.

You have the lines backwards. Could you place resistance above and support below?

Change by this

[#property](/en/docs/basis/preprosessor/compilation "MQL5 Documentation: Program Properties (#property)") indicator\_label1 "Resistance"

#property indicator\_label2 "Support"

Forget about BMP files like a bad dream. Thanks to this library, you can now use the PNG format, which has a number of advantages, such as being more compact without losing image quality and maintaining transparency.

The EA trades using the Rectangle, EMA and SMA indicators.

![Moving Average with alerts on price crossovers](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Moving Average with alerts on price crossovers](/en/code/45552)

I wanted to build a moving average which would create an alert when the price moves over the line by a user defined amount of points.
It creates both bullish and bearish signals depending on the direction of market price moving through the MA. It is designed for slow length moving averages (default is 200-day MA).
EDIT: I now added a second version of the indicator which uses Arrow buffers instead of ObjectCreate.
