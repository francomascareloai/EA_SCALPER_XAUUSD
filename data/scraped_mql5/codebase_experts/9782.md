hi adaheem,

chech the extern int PeriodMA = 13;

mt4 doesn't not have chart for M13

try change the code

```mql5
double MA_bar0 =iMA(NULL,0,PeriodMA,0,0,0,shift);
   double MA_bar1 =iMA(NULL,0,PeriodMA,0,0,0,shift+1);
```

to

```mql5
double MA_bar0 =iMA(NULL,0,0,0,0,0,shift);
   double MA_bar1 =iMA(NULL,0,0,0,0,0,shift+1);
```

so it will follow the chart time frame

that is my opinion, now in office, can not test it

The best are always just a few blocks of code. Great work here. A true gem :)
