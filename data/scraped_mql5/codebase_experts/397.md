The entropy is the measure of the disorder of the system. The [entropy](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.foretrade.com/entropy.htm "http://www.foretrade.com/entropy.htm") is calculated using the [Maximum Entropy Method](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximumEntropyMethod.html "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximumEntropyMethod.html").

If we try to evaluate it according to its indicative attributes without paying much attention to its code, we will find out that it is an ordinary unnormalized [oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators) and it is possible to apply to it all appropriate technical analysis methods. The indicator was presented in two variants - as a line (Entropy.mq5) and as a multicolored histogram (ColorEntropy.mq5).

This indicator was first implemented in MQL4 and published in [Code Base at mql4.com](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/8240) 5.07.2008.

Interesting turkey, have a desire to experiment with it.

You're using this to calculate the [entropy:](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/412 "Article: Application of the Eigen-Coordinates Method to Structural Analysis of Nonextensive Statistical Distributions")

G = P \* MathLog(1.0 + rmsx) + (1.0 - P) \* MathLog(1.0 - rmsx)

where P = (1.0 + avgx/rmsx)/2.0;

But I thought this was the general formula for entropy: Sum(p(i) \* log(p(i)))

Yet you're using different value for p(i) in the log: i.e 1.0 +/- rmsx. Could you please explain?

Thankyou for this. I wish there were more indicators like this with a bit of difference to their approach, rather than just the same indicators over and over again from people re-inventing the wheel!
