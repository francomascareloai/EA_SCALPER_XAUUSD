### Trading strategy

The custom indicator 'PriceChannel\_Signal\_v2' ( [I took the indicator here](/en/forum/173249/page132#comment_15924070) ) generates several signals: two types of signals to open a 'BUY' position, two types of signals to open a 'SELL' position, one signal to close 'BUY' and one signal to close 'SELL'. No Stop Loss, No Take Profit, No Trailing.

**An example of opening a position:**

![PriceChannel_Signal_v2 EA](https://c.mql5.com/18/103/2022-04-15_18h17_30.png "PriceChannel_Signal_v2 EA")

Rice. 1. PriceChannel\_Signal\_v2 EA

**Peculiarities:**

* The EA can be optimized for the working timeframe ('**Working timeframe**')
* There can be only one 'entry to the market' deal per bar
* When working in the '*inside bar*' mode (parameter '**Search signals on ...**'   equals '***bar #0 (at every tick)***') the current bar is bar #0, when working in the mode '*only at the moment of birth of a new bar*'   (parameter '**Search signals on ...**'   equals '***bar #1 (on a new bar)*** )   current bar is bar #1

Now more about each group of parameters:

**Trading settings:**

> '**Working timeframe**' - working timeframe. The timeframe on which indicators are created and on which a new bar is searched.

**Position size management (lot calculation)**

> The lot can be either permanent ('**Money management**' set to '***Constant lot***' and set the lot size to '**The value for "Money management"**') and dynamic - in percent risk per trade ('**Money management**' set to '**Risk in percent for a deal**' and set the risk percentage in '**The value for "Money management"**'). You can also set a constant lot equal to the minimum lot - '**Money management**' set to '***Lots Min***'.

**Additional features:**

> Flag '**Positions: Only one**' set to '***true***' allows the EA to have no more than one position in the market. '**Print log**' prints an extended log of all operations.

Hello Mr Vladimir, I really like your work and thank you very much for what you do.

When a position is opened with Enter or Re-enter in this advisor and X occurs,

can you close the position and open a trade in the opposite direction?

Thank you

Yes, that would be useful, as would the breakeven and trailing stop options.
