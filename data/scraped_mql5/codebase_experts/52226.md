A simple script to translate the monetary figure of a risk percentage (1% to 10%). The risk is calculated based on the account balance.

It is a useful tool for manual traders as now you can quickly see what 1% risk means for the stop loss, or what X% reward should mean for the take profit.

The figures will always update based on the current account balance, and you no longer have to base a stop loss or take profit on an arbitrary amount of money or points.

The script will exit automatically after giving you enough time to see the information, and the chart will no longer be hidden after the script terminates.

Hi Conor

Very useful script. However I could not find any currency conversion in the code for risk to measure in [Account Currency](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_info_string "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"), which is more likely to be amount of interest.

Thanks

The currency symbol I used was hardcoded, I wasn't sure if there was a way to retrieve the correct currency symbol automatically. The calculation itself is simple so the figures should still be accurate (just the currency symbol might be wrong)

Updated it now. I found a way to retrieve the currency symbol for the [account currency](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_info_string "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"). Also improved the code so there's no missing text labels.
