The Smoothed Correlation Indicator provides an indication of price trending and ranging through a bar to bar correlation coefficient. A indicator value approaching one is an indication of up or down trending.  An indicator value approaching 0 is an indication of price ranging.  A negative indicator value suggests whipsawing price action.

The correlation period is set by the **CorrPer** input and the smoothing period is set by the **SmthPeriod** input.

**bdrstocks:**  
 Looks good. Do you find it to be
successful for decisions?

On its own, it will not guide you on a Buy vs Sell decision but it will help in identifying conditions where the price is trending.  Then,
with other indicators, such as SMA crossing or stochastics it does help.  I have some unpublished EAs that use this philosphy
successfully in [backtesting](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article \"Testing trading strategies on real ticks\""), but have not yet applied it to any of my real time trading EAs.

I have updated this indictor to use the [bar change](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/series/bars "MQL5 documentation: Bars function") (close-open), rather than the bar close for bar to bar correlation calculation.

Select the file CorrlnDeltaSmth at the top.  It should download to your Download folder or you Metatrader 4 Indicator folder.

Hi, so I just made a little code here that will help out a lot of coders that hate doing this (I count myself in it haha). It's made to calculate the lot size of a position based on the risk input and the account size+currency.
