Two identical trading systems (for long and short deals) based on the [ColorMaRsi-Trigger](/en/code/1126 "SilverTrend - an indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator signals that can be configured in different ways within a single EA with an ability to change the volume of a forthcoming trade depending on the results of the previous trades for this trading system. This EA was obtained by further complicating the [Exp\_ColorMaRsi-Trigger\_Duplex](/en/code/22491) trading system to change the volumes of the positions to be opened.

For this purpose, the blocks of the EA's input parameters have been added:

```mql5
input uint    L_TotalMMTriger=5;    //L number of the last Buy deals to calculate stop loss
input uint    L_LossMMTriger=3;     //L number of losing Buy deals to reduce MM
input double  L_SmallMM=0.01;       //L Share of a deposit in a deal in case of loss
input double  L_MM=0.1;             //L Share of a deposit in a deal during normal trading
input MarginMode L_MMMode=LOT;      //L lot setting mode
```

and

```mql5
input uint    S_TotalMMTriger=5;    //S number of the last Sell deals to calculate stop loss
input uint    S_LossMMTriger=3;     //S number of losing Sell deals to reduce MM
input double  S_SmallMM=0.01;       //S Share of a deposit in a deal in case of loss
input double  S_MM=0.1;             //S Share of a deposit in a deal during normal trading
input MarginMode S_MMMode=LOT;      //S lot setting mode
```

In case of such inputs and when selecting from the last five trades, three of which are loss-making in a single direction, the EA opens the next trade in the same direction having the volume of 0.01 lot. If there are less than three loss-making trades out of the last five ones, the position volume is 0.1.

For the EA to operate, the compiled file of indicator **ColorMaRsi-Trigger.ex5** should be in the <terminal\_data\_directory>\MQL5\Indicators.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters were used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit were not used during the tests.
