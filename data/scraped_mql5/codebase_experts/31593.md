**Ayeni Joseph Wonderful:**  

Thank you for the script, its really a useful tool for intraday scalping.

I will like to ask, how can one use this tool for swing trading on higher TF like 1hr/4hr?

[@Ayeni Joseph Wonderful](/en/users/hefhem911) great question by the way.

Actually this script is based on the H1 Time-frame, so it is possible from the excelsheet to combine every 4 hours in one candlestick.

Anyway I just made some modifications on this script that will allow you now to get the H4 instead of the H1. You can consult the script in the attache file

Hey [@olotololuwa](/en/users/olotololuwa)

There is a script for MT4 and for MT5

This one here is for the MT5

if you want to have the MT4 go to this link https://www.mql5.com/en/code/31594

[ECN Trade Modifier](/en/code/31509)

On all MT4 market execution accounts (ECN, ECN Zero and Pro), preset stoploss/takeprofit price levels are not permitted.
If a client wishes to specify stoploss/takeprofit values for an order, the client must modify the existing position after the order is opened.
This EA helps a client effortlessly ensure that an on order is modified to desired stoploss/takeprofit values a short while after a trade position is opened
This is especially helpful for scalpers who want to avoid the trouble of manually editing trade properties every-time a position is taken on a financial instrument.
