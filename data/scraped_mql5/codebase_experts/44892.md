It is common for novice developers to face the challenge of making the Expert Advisor able to detect if there are open orders independently, without using the OrdersTotal() function, as this does not recognize if an order was opened by an EA or if it was opened manually, since it returns the total amount of open orders.

With that in mind, I decided to share this very simple code. In it, I use the Comment() function as a way to demonstrate the Check\_Open\_Orders function in real time.

The code is extensively explanatory with descriptive notes. I hope it is useful.

KA-Gold Bot is an advanced trading advisor specifically designed for gold, utilizing the powerful combination of the Keltner channel strategy and two exponential moving averages (EMAs) - the 10-period EMA and the 200-period EMA.
Principle of Operation: The 10-period EMA represents the average price cutting above/below the Keltner band, confirming an uptrend/downtrend. The price being above the 200-period EMA supports the uptrend/downtrend. This indicates that the uptrend/downtrend has been stronger than the previous 10 periods, considering the volatility over the last 50 periods.
