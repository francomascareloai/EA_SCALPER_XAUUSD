The Exp\_derivative Expert Advisor is based on the breakthrough of the zero level by the [Derivative](/en/code/13902) indicator. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is breakthrough of the zero level from above or below.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file derivative.ex5 in order to run. Place it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
