The indicator displays the balance and equity of the trade account.

This indicator is especially useful when used in the strategy tester. It visualizes the balance and equity:

To apply the indicator in the tester, it should be included in the tester template "tester.tpl". This how it is done:

* open any chart
* clear the chart of unnecessary indicators, objects and experts (preferably all)
* drag the "LifeHack Balance Equity" indicator to the chart
* then right click on the chart — "Templates" — "Save Template ..." — enter the name "tester.tpl".

Now the "LifeHack Balance Equity" indicator will be built into the Tester chart.

I found out this indicator only shows data for the day, it resets when new day start. Can you make it save history or at least not reset when new day start? That would be greatly helpful.

Vladimir Karputov:

No and no again. This indicator DOES NOT WORK with trading history - this indicator works with data that comes online.

Sayberix:

The last edit of version 1.010 has not been entered into kodobase, please correct it if not difficult.

harry owuor:

could you make the indicator display the change in price based on seconds.you probably noticed that when you move to the lower timeframes (m1), the equity would stall and print a straight line representing price consolidation so maybe one could use the info to exit or manage loss/profits
