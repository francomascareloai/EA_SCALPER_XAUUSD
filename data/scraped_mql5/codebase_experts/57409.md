RRS Tangled EA is a cleaned and advanced version of [**RRS Chaotic EA**](/en/code/57246) and [**RRS Randomness in Nature EA**](/en/code/57209). This EA randomly selects currency symbols, lot sizes, and order types for trading. It does not rely on technical indicators or fundamental analysis. Instead, it uses a **Randomness in Nature** approach to open trades. With proper settings such as **Take Profit, Stop Loss, Trailing,** and **Risk Management**, this EA can generate significant profits.

This is a **multi-currency** or **multi-asset** EA, meaning that even if it is attached to a single currency pair chart, it can trade other currency pairs and manage all operations related to the trades it has opened.

| **Variable** | **Values** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **minLot\_Size** | Double Value | Minimum lot size to ensure lot size randomness does not go below this value. |
| **maxLot\_Size** | Double Value | Maximum lot size to ensure lot size randomness does not exceed this value. |
| **StopLoss** | Int Value | Set your stop loss value in points/pips (the smallest price movement unit for your asset).   Set Stop Loss to **0** to disable it. |
| **TakeProfit** | Int Value | Set your take profit value in points/pips.   Set Take Profit to **0** to disable it. |
| **Trailing\_Start** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Specify the number of pips from the open trade price at which trailing should begin.   Set Trailing Start to **0** to disable the trailing operation. |
| **Trailing\_Gap** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Set the gap in pips between the current market price and the trailing stop loss.   Set Trailing Gap to **0** to disable the trailing operation. |
| **Risk\_In\_Money\_Type** | FixedMoney, BalancePercentage | **FixedMoney:** Closes all open trades when the negative floating reaches your specified amount.   **BalancePercentage:** Automatically calculates based on your account balance and closes all trades once this limit is reached. |
| **Money\_In\_Risk** | Int Value | If **Risk\_In\_Money\_Type** is set to **FixedMoney**, enter the amount of money you can afford to lose.   If set to **BalancePercentage**, the EA will automatically calculate the risk based on your account balance and close all trades when that limit is reached. |
| **Max\_Spread** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Sets the maximum acceptable spread. If the current spread exceeds this value, the EA will not take a trade and will wait for the spread to return within the specified limit. |
| **Slippage** | Int Value (Points/Pips) | Set the maximum allowed slippage for order execution. |
| **MaxOpenTrade** | Int Value | Maximum number of open trades allowed |

**Good Luck, Happy Trading!**

There is some Error in your code. I got always the info "[Not enough money](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/errorswarnings/enum_trade_return_codes "MQL5 Documentation: Insufficient funds to complete the request")", but i reduced to fixed money with 0.01 Lot and also reduced tto 0.1 Risk with a deposit 10.000 USD

[RRS Chaotic EA](/en/code/57246)

This EA is a cleaned and minimized version of the RRS Randomness in Nature EA. It opens trades randomly with random currency pairs, random lot sizes, and random order types. This EA does not rely on any technical skillset such as indicators, price action, news calendar events, or candlestick patterns. It offers multiple trading strategies, risk management plans, and other customizable settings.

This EA is truly random in nature. It randomly selects currency pairs, lot sizes, and order types. This EA does not rely on any technical skillset such as indicators, price action, news calendar events, or candlestick patterns. It offers multiple trading strategies, risk management plans, and other customizable settings.
Even though the EA works on randomness, it has still achieved good profits with proper risk management settings.

[Withdrawal Tracking](/en/code/57675)

This is a piece of code to add to an existing Expert advisor to track withdrawals from your account where the EA is running. It helps the user to monitor his or her withdrawals from a particular account.

![Average Pip Movement based on Tick And Seconds](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Average Pip Movement based on Tick And Seconds](/en/code/57788)

This Expert Advisor (EA) analyzes market movement by calculating the average pip movement per tick and the average spread over a user-defined number of ticks (MAX\_TICKS). It also evaluates the average pip movement and spread over a specified time interval (CHECK\_SECONDS).
The EA dynamically tracks price changes and spread values, printing the results in the terminal and displaying them on the chart using the Comment() function. This helps traders gauge market volatility and spread fluctuations in real time.
