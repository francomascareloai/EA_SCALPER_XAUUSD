MACD is usually calculated with an addition of one signal line  
  
That
is a long used trading system and has it's merits. But that way is
somewhat lacking when it comes to ranging markets (it can not detect
false signals in ranging market)  
This version is using dsl
(discontinued signal lines) and instead of using one signal line uses
two. That way it sort of introduces levels as well as signal lines and,
judging from tests, it seems to be better in avoiding false signals and
it can be used in (short term) reversals detection. As usual, testing is
advised before usage.
