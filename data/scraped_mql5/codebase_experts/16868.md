The Expert Advisor opens an initial position in the current candle's direction and increases its volume if profit in points increases a threshold fixed in the EA inputs.

The data on addings are stored in a string comment to a position in the following format: *number of addings/last trade price/last trade volume*.

The initial position can be opened any time when the current candle's body exceeds the PriceStep threshold, as well as add to it when the threshold is exceeded at a new bar arrival.

Originally this EA has been written in MQL4 and was first published in the [Code Base](/en/code/15957) on 18.07.2016.

This sort of trading needs to use ATR to adjust the three inputs "price step", " SL" and "TP". This would eliminate the need for optimization. Also ATR could dynamically adjust the slow times.
