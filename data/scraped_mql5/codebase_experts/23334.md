**Idea by:** [Scriptor](/en/users/scriptor "Scriptor")

**mq5 code by:** [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn)

The EA searches for a daily range. It uses objects OBJ\_HLINE and OBJ\_VLINE.

A daily range within **Sliding window size** days (current bar #0 is not involved in calculations) can be calculated as Highest - Lowest or as a mean value by module Close #i - Close #i+1. Calculation mode is set in **Daily range**.

The daily range is then used in the calculations of levels Stop Loss and Take Profit:

SL = daily\_range \* **Stop Loss Coefficient**

TP = daily\_range \* **Take Profit Coefficient**

The daily range is calculated once a day (time **Start hour**::**Start minute**) and at the first launch of the EA.

BUY signal:

Price Ask >= Highest of the daily range + daily\_range \* **Offset Coefficient**

SELL signal:

Price Bid <= Lowest of the daily range - daily\_range \* **Offset Coefficient**

Number of positions opened within the current day shall be limited by parameter **Max Positions**.

Search for a daily range is visualized using two vertical lines (the limit the search range) and two horizontal lines (that show the lines of position opening signals) :
