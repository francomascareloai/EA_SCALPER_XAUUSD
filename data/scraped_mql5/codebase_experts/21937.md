**Obtaining trading signals.**

Indicators (iMA (Moving Average, MA), iMACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence, MACD), iStochastic (Stochastic Oscillator), iOsMA (Moving Average of Oscillator, OsMA) and iAO (Awesome Oscillator, AO)) are surveyed in a strict sequence: confirmation from all indicators is necessary for a positive signal. If the confirmation chain lacks confirmation even from a single indicator, the entire signal is sorted out.

The EA works only when a new bar appears, so it can be optimized in the "OHLC" ticks generation mode.
