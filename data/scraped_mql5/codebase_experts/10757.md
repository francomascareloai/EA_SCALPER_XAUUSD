* BuyPoint- If RSI crosses this point upwards a buy order will be sent.
* SellPoint- If RSI crosses this point downwards a sell order will be sent.
* CloseOnOpposite- If true if an opposite signal is given all trades that had been opened with the previous signal will be closed.

**Adrian Iorga:**  
 Hi I just used your RSI trader and it's great but I have a question? Can you please tell me how can I set it to open multiple buy and [sell orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_book_type "MQL5 documentation: Trade Orders in Depth Of Market") in the same time (every time when RSI indicator touches the buy/sell points even if a previous order is still opened)?

yes, how can we fix it?

what is slip? Many members asked. Suppose you put some ending order on any pair on some example price of 1960.255
if you put more slip like 30 or 50 then if price reach 1960.280 or 1960.230 your order will be active. (slip is the gap between the price of broker and your order) if you put slip 0 then your order will not be active till the price reach exact 1960.255
