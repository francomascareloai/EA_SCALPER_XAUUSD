Hello Traders, I hope y'all like this quick little script. The script is designed to make creating new charts a little quicker. Every time a new chart is created you will need to set your color theme. This annoyed me so I created this script to have three color themes. The color themes are easily edited to make this suit your needs. For me I have it set to green/red, Aqua/Pink, and Black/White. Find the color you want to change. The varible for colors will start with clr then the color. Repeat ths pattern with your choice. Example Below

```mql5
      case PINK_AQUA:    //A Personal Favorite Color Design 
         bullishColor = clrAqua;
         bearishColor = clrHotPink;
         backgroundColor = clrBlack;
         gridColor = clrSlateGray;
         textColor = clrWhite;
         break;
```

Now to use it. Make a new chart, drag the script to the chart,  pick your theme hit okay.

"Every time a new chart is created you will need to set your color theme."

- Its not true. If you set your template with name "default" every time you open a new chart it will open same template

AFAICU, the idea is to delimit color scheme from a template as a whole, because by applying a template you are risking to change not only colors but current program environment (objects, indicators, modes, etc) of the chart as well.
