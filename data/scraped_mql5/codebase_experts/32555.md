Clarity index is a purely volume based indicator which is constructed on basis of volume, range and positive/negative candle count. It reflects the strength of trend with respect to volume.

**Usage :**

You can use the zero line cross for trend confirmation.

**HosseinKOGO:**  

Hi,

Is this indicator about [Trade Volume](/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/prices#enum_applied_volume_enum "MQL5 documentation: Price Constants") or just Tick Volume?

It uses tick volume as only that is available in forex.

I can not understand. How does [tick volume](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/prices#enum_applied_volume_enum "MQL5 documentation: Price Constants") could result to decide a trend is weak or strong? Can you tell me a bit about the idea behind it?

In simple words tick volume shows the fight between the buyers and sellers. Higher tick volume means bigger fight. So basically the resulting candle(bearish or bullish) shows us who won thereby letting us know the will of the market.

Thank you for your clarification.
