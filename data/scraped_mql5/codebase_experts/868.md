The indicator values are calculated by this formula :

* For first period (red color) = (Close - LowValue) / (HighValue - LowValue)

> The value is between 0 - 1.  
> The higher value means uptrend, the lowest value means downtrend, value in the middle means sideway.

* For second period (blue color) = (Close - LowValue)\*-1 / (HighValue - LowValue)

> The value is between -1 - 0.  
> The higher value means downtrend, the lowest value means uptrend, value in the middle means sideway.

where :

* HighValue - the highest high for n period;
* LowValue - the lowest low for n period;

**Input parameters:**

* **InpPeriod1 -** First period for calculating trend;
* **InpPeriod2 -** Second period for calculating trend;
