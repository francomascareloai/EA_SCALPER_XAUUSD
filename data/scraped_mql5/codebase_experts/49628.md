 I don't think they bothered to compile this. Or want someone else to fix what they can't. return value of 'OrderSend' should be checked 01 HarmonicEA.mq4 124 9 return value of 'OrderSend' should be checked 01 HarmonicEA.mq4 140 9 return value of 'OrderModify' should be checked 01 HarmonicEA.mq4 187 21 return value of 'OrderModify' should be checked 01 HarmonicEA.mq4 195 21 I'll fix this later by turning it in to an indicator that don't place trades and trail stops. I rather use my own discretion on entry anyways.

Do you really think that a warning is a problem to compile ? Do You know how to fix this warnings? just anticipate with a int ticket=OrderSend(....) and bool mod=OrderModify(....)   
It's easy.

Could you solve this ? some variable is zero so you can use a if ( variable != 0 ) { do this... } ;

I think it could be a good idea add a margin in the calculation of patterns, an error margin.. some time patterns are not 100% like theory, so use something to be more flexible, adaptable.  
  
I will check the code better. Thank's.

// Calculate the [Fibonacci retracement](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object "MQL5 documentation: Object Types") levels  
    double XA = High[1] - Low[1];  
    double AB = High[2] - Low[2];  
    double BC = High[1] - Low[2];  
    double CD = High[3] - Low[2];

This gives the value of closed candle 1,2 and 3. Can you find a harmonic pattern in 3 candles ? No...

Harmonic AI Pattern

why write Harmonic AI Patten ? Just to call the attention ?

Or waste other people's time...
