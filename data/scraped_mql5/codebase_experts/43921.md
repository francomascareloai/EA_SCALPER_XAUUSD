### You have developed your own MT4/MT5 indicator ?

* For your personal usage
* For your clients

### Just add 3 lines of code to your MQL4/MQL5 file to:

* Connect your indicator to Telegram
* Send messages to Telegram
* Send signals to Telegram
* Trade signals from Telegram
* Add trading capabilities to your Indicator (open, close and manage positions
* Join an amazing eco-system ;)

### Just an indicator among many others (including yours)

* Can be attached to several charts (different pairs and timeframe)
* Detect several (maybe too many) trading opportunities per day
* No trading capabilites

### The challenge

* Notify me on trading opportunities : the signal
* Adapt the signal to my money management and trading hours
* Filter the signal
* Trade the signal quickly and safely
* Manage open positions
* Keep me informed on Telegram

[![Your indicator](https://c.mql5.com/18/146/Image3__1.png "Your indicator")](https://c.mql5.com/18/146/Image3.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/146/Image3.png")

### Add 3 lines of code into your indicator

* Include the file OfirBlueAPI.mqh. The purpose of this file is to connect your indicator with Ofir blue
* OnInit: Initialize Ofir Blue
* Where you usually draw the signal (Arrow for example), call Ofir Blue method to send it

Did you not read the description? This is not for beginners or non-coders. You have to know how to code.

Sure, but a beginner could add 3 lines to an existing code. Maybe some tests are required...

![Change TPSL By Percentage](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Change TPSL By Percentage](/en/code/43951)

The Expert will help you change the TP/SL of all open orders by setting the TP/SL based on the input percentage value.

![AllAverages v4.9](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[AllAverages v4.9](/en/code/43879)

One of the latest version of this indicator at the moment. Huge base of different modifications of moving averages, with multitimesframe function, sending signals to e-mail and push notifications.

![Auto TP multiplied by SL](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Auto TP multiplied by SL](/en/code/43973)

Th Expert will set the TP based on the SL manually set using the input multiplier. Using this you can set 2,3,4 etc times the SL set.

![ChartButton Class MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[ChartButton Class MT4](/en/code/44020)

This class allows you to create buttons on the chart as if they were chart objects(have time and price coordinates) these objects can be dragged on the chart and when scrolling they stay at the same place. If you wan't to learn some Object Oriented Programming or if you wan't to understand how chartevents work or you wan't to create graphical interfaces, you can learn a lot from this.
