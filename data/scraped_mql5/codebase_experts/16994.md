**Vasily48:**  
 What should be corrected in the robot code so that when it should buy it sells.

The main decision-making block is here:

double bup=iBandsGet(UPPER\_BAND,0);  
   double bdn=iBandsGet(LOWER\_BAND,0);  
//

And then you have to look at the errors.

**Vladimir Karputov:**  

The main decision-making unit is here:

double bup=iBandsGet(UPPER\_BAND,0);  
   double bdn=iBandsGet(LOWER\_BAND,0);  
//  
   if(iClose(0)>bup+(ExtBDistance\*Point()))  
      SELLme=true;  
   if(iClose(0)<bdn-(ExtBDistance\*Point()))  
      BUYme=true;

And then you have to look at the mistakes.

And why to change and it is pulling quite well.... thanks to Barabashkin....Yet favourite Martin wouldn't hurt, drawdowns are rare, but marks... Martin would make up for it...

What programme do you use to reverse the chart? ) I have it the other way round

Greatest, consistently profitable tests, provided testing OHLC M1, but if you choose the [mode of testing](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/algotrading/testing "Tick generation modes in MetaTrader 5 Client Terminal") on all ticks, then the Expert Advisor is sure to drain.... Tell me how to solve it in the end
