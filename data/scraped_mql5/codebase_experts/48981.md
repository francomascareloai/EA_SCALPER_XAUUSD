This script sets pending hedges with distance in pips for chart symbol.

If hedged are 100% harmonized strategy will do nothing,

else calculates difference between Buy and Sell Trades and places a harmonized pending hedge 100%.

Deletes old hedges for symbol and places new ones.

This way can be used as manual trailing pending hedges, when desired.

I use this strategy often, so I consider is useful enough to share it with you.

Thanks for sharing.

Do you have screenshot of what exactly it is doing? I am great fan of hedging.

Hello Sunil Sharma,

Thank you for your message.

A "pending hedge" order typically refers to placing an order that will only be executed when certain conditions are met, such as when the market reaches a specific price level.

This type of order is commonly used in trading strategies to manage risk or to enter the market at desired levels.

For example you open a buy EURUSD position 0.1. On EURUSD Chart when you run the script an EURUSD sellstop order will be placed at 20 pips to protect yourself of  further downtrends.

Furthermore you wait for the next trading opportunity and act according with your trading stile.

I hope this will help.

Changing the size of the chart window is important in my EA, but it may serve as inspiration for others.
