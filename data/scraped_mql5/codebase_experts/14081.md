The [MA\_Rounding](/en/code/1211) indicator with additional trend strength indication using colored dots based on the standard deviation algorithm.

If the standard deviation of the MA\_Rounding indicator is between the dK1 and dK2 parameter values, then a small colored dot appears on the moving average. Its color corresponds to the current trend direction.

```mql5
input double dK1=1.5;  // Square-law filter coefficient 1
input double dK2=2.5;  // Square-law filter coefficient 2
```

  

If the standard deviation becomes higher than the dK2 input parameter value, then the dot size increases. Thus, we get 3 levels of trend strength indication:

1. Weak — no dots;
2. Medium — small colored dots;
3. Strong — big colored dots.

The indicator uses the СMoving\_Average and CXMA classes of the SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library. Working with that class was described in details in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).
