The Fuzzy Logic - is a modern science, used in many fields, for example, it has military applications. Now it's available for the traders.

Why Fuzzy Logic? There are some systems, easily can be solved by human, but it's difficult to program these systems. In such cases Fuzzy Logic can help. It's very close to the logic of a human mind.

The archive file contains:

* Dll of the [Free Fuzzy Logic Library](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://ffll.sourceforge.net/index.html "http://ffll.sourceforge.net/index.html")
* the library (.mqh) file with description of imported functions

**[Free Fuzzy Logic Library API](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://ffll.sourceforge.net/api/index.html "http://ffll.sourceforge.net/api/index.html")**

**How to use dll**

First of all, you need to call the **ffll\_new\_model()** functon to create a model, then download the FCL program from a file, using the function **ffll\_load\_fcl\_file(int model\_idx, string file)**, and create a child model, using the **ffll\_new\_child(int model\_idx)** function. Now the model is ready to use.

Now you can specify the input parameters for the model, using the **ffll\_set\_value(int model\_idx, int child\_idx, int var\_idx, double value) function**, the index corresponds to the order of the parameter when declared, it starts from the zero. Then you can get the output, using the **double ffll\_get\_output\_value(int model\_idx, int child\_idx)** function.

Each model has only one output, but you can use several models for different purposes. Of course, for its effective use you should learn the Fuzzy Logic principles.

At the first stage, the program from site [http://www.louderthanabomb.com/](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.louderthanabomb.com/ "http://www.louderthanabomb.com/") will be useful for you, but it doesn't allow to edit the files.

Using this program you can check the correctness of the FCL program and visualize the necessary functions.

I will be glad to anwer you questions at the reference, in the code.

Тут не понял, с какого сайта? Ткните плз.

From the official site of the library - ffll.sourceforge.net.

More precisely: [http://ffll.sourceforge.net/downloads.htm](/go?link=https://ffll.sourceforge.net/downloads.htm "https://ffll.sourceforge.net/downloads.htm") -> Download a sample application that uses FFLL.

There is C++ code and a simple fcl model.

Well, maybe it is easier to link MATLAB with MT4/MT5? Especially the solutions have already been proposed.

Where to read it?

I would like to hear the "head of the transport shop" who announced this topic and wrote that everything worked wonderfully in MT4.

The problem is that the .fcl file is not loaded.

By the way: the library does not fully support the standard. There are exceptions, limitations, etc. And the output is only single-element sets.

It worked after specifying the full path of the file location.

string path=StringConcatenate(TerminalPath(),"\experts\files\Histo1.fcl");

The spread\_on\_chart indicator shows the current values of spread, stop and freeze levels.

![MACD - Any higher timeframe](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[MACD - Any higher timeframe](/en/code/153)

This indicator is based on simple MACD but allows you to choose also timeframe of indicator, different from current. You can choose current timeframe of chart (then indicator shows the same values as common MACD) or any higher timeframe.
