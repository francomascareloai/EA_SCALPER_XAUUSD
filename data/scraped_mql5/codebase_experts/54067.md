Another version of ZigZag, where the step size for changing the direction of the segment is set in price points.

This version has additional options to enable:

* 1. You can display the level lines that correspond to the last extremes (Maximum / Minimum) of the zigzag.
* 2. Enable displaying the size of the waves in points. Indicates how many points the price has passed from level to level.

The indicator settings allow you to choose a color for each zigzag element, etc.
