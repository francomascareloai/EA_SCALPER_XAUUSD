**Features:**

* Overlay candles from any past date directly onto the current chart.

+ Automatic adjustment of replay zone/magnifier to match live chart movement.

* Dynamic tooltips showing:

1. Time.
2. Open, High, Low, Close.
3. Candle Range.
4. Bullish/Bearish direction.
5. Volume.

* Customizable colors for bullish/bearish candles and zones.
* Interactive zone for selecting and dragging overlay region.
* Works on intraday timeframes (e.g. M1 to H1).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| InpReplayDate | Date to fetch historical candles from. |
| InpMainZoneColor | Color for the main live zone rectangle. |
| InpReplayZoneColor | Color for the replay overlay zone. |
| InpBullColor | Color for bullish replay candles. |
| InpBearColor | Color for bearish replay candles. |

**How to Use:**

A simple step-by-step guide:

1. Attach the indicator to a chart (preferable intraday).
2. Select the **Replay Date** using input panel.
3. The indicator will draw a red "Main Zone" on your current chart.
4. A green "Replay Zone" will display historical candles mapped to the same relative position and size.
5. Hover over the replay bars to see candle details.

What's inside the Zones?

* The **first candle** in the Main Zone (on the left) corresponds to the first candle from the selected **ReplayDate**.
* The **current live candle** (on the right of the red zone) is aligned with the **last candle** of the green Replay Zone.
* This lets you easily see:

1. "*How did the market behave at this position last time?*".
2. "*Are we repeating a similar pattern?*".

What's around my current Candlestick?

* The **current candlestick** (last bar in the red Main Zone) corresponds exactly to the **last candle** in the green Replay Zone - they are aligned in both **time position** and **open price**.
* The **first candle on the left** of the Main Zone is matched to the **first candle** of the Replay Zone (from the selected ReplayDate).
* The **last (current) candle** of the Main Zone is matched to the **last candle** from the Replay Zone - their **opening prices are identica**l for comparison.
* This lets you answer:

> 1. "*What did price do next the last time we were at the same level and time of day?*".

**Notes and Limitations:**

* **Zone Range:**Large replay ranges may impact performance on low-end devices.
* **No Wicks:**Only candle bodies are drawn, upper and lower shadows are not shown.
* **No buffers:** This indicator uses only chart objects (rectangles), not indicator buffers.
* **Redraws every new bar:** The full replay zone is **re-rendered** on each new tick or bar, which is not optimized for performance.
* **Market Closed on Replay date:** If the market was closed on the selected ReplayDate, **no candles will appear**.
* **Replay Offset Risk:** If some bars are missing on the replay date, the green replay zone may **misalign**, and the current candle's open price may not match the replay candles open price.
* **Only intraday timeframes supported:** This tool is designed for intraday use (below daily timeframe). Not intended for D1/W1/M1.
