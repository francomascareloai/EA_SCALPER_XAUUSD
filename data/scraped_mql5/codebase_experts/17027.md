The trading system based on crossing of the DI+ and DI- lines of the [Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud](/en/code/17018) indicator. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is crossing of red and green lines of the indicator.

Place Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud.ex5 and Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud\_HTF.ex5 compiled files to the *<terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators*.

The Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud\_HTF indicator in the EA is intended only for a more convenient visualization of trends in the strategy tester, in other operation modes it is inactive.

After compilation, the Exp\_Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud.ex5 expert file contains the Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud.ex5 and Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud\_HTF.ex5 indicators as [resources](/en/docs/runtime/resources), and therefore, they are not required to be present in the terminal folder for the compiled EA to work! For this purpose, the corresponding code has been added to the EA code in order to include these indicators in the expert's executable file.

The indicator executable files have been added as resources at the global scope

//---- Include the indicators in the EA code as resources  
#resource "\\Indicators\\Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud.ex5"   
#resource \\Indicators\\Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud\_HTF.ex5

Changed the string paths to the indicators used as resources in the block of the OnInit() function

//---- getting handle of the Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud indicator  
   InpInd\_Handle=iCustom(Symbol(),InpInd\_Timeframe,"::Indicators\\Fractal\_ADX\_Cloud",e\_period,normal\_speed,IPC,0);

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

The indicator is awesome, BUT not with the EA.

How come always hedging my position, each time I place manual order?? After some difficulty to translate Russian, the final result is dissapointed....
