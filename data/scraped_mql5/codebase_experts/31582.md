Author: [Kenneth Parling](/en/users/kenpar "kenpar")

Hello ,

1- I linked this EA to my virtual account. In the image you posted, in the "inputs" section there is the field where you can modify the lot while I am not there and therefore I cannot modify the lot, In fact the operations have all been opened on the basic lot equal to 0 , 01

2- I tested this EA for a whole day, just to check if it worked, I noticed that it only opened long trades and that they were opened immediately after the previous one closed (for reaching TP or SL). So I thought that the strategy is to always go in the same direction as the current trend on the H1 time frame, I guessed it?

3- for a correct functioning of this EA, are the values of TP and SL those indicated by you? ie SL 54 pips and TP 47 pips?

4- do the bulls power increas and bear power decrease fields serve to set the trailing stop?

![ECN Trade Modifier](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[ECN Trade Modifier](/en/code/31509)

On all MT4 market execution accounts (ECN, ECN Zero and Pro), preset stoploss/takeprofit price levels are not permitted.
If a client wishes to specify stoploss/takeprofit values for an order, the client must modify the existing position after the order is opened.
This EA helps a client effortlessly ensure that an on order is modified to desired stoploss/takeprofit values a short while after a trade position is opened
This is especially helpful for scalpers who want to avoid the trouble of manually editing trade properties every-time a position is taken on a financial instrument.

For day traders, this is one of the important thing to consider in order to improve our strategy by calculating on average how much an asset moves, in which it will allow us to identify the best TIME during the day to trade when the market moves the most as well
