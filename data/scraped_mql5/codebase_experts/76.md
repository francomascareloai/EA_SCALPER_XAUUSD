[Triple Exponential Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/tea) (TRIX) was developed by Jack Hutson as an oscillator of the overbought/oversold market conditions.

It can also be used as the Momentum indicator. Triple smoothing is used for removing the cyclic components in price movements with the period less than that of TRIX.

The zone is used as the indicator of overbought or oversold state (positive and negative respectively). The signal to by is crossing of the zero line from below, or "bulls'" divergence; the signal to sell is the indicator's crossing the zero line from above, or "bears'" divergence with prices. The distinctive feature of the indicator is the perfect filtration of price noises and absence of lag that is so typical of most moving averages.

Triple Exponential Average Indicator

**Calculation:**

First the [Exponential Moving Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma) of a price is calculated:

EMA1(i) = EMA(Price, N, i)

where:  

* Price(i) - current price;
* N - EMA period;
* EMA1(i) - current value of the Exponential Moving Average.

Then the second smoothing of the obtained average is performed - double exponential smoothing:

EMA2(i) = EMA(EMA1, N, i).

The double Exponential Moving Average is smoothed exponentially once again - we get the Triple Exponential Moving Average:

EMA3(i) = EMA(EMA2, N, i);

Now the indicator itself is calculated:

TRIX(i) = (EMA3(i) - EMA3(i - 1))/ EMA3(i-1)

There is a small inaccuracy in the indicator.

It's like this:

```mql5
for(int i=0;i<limit;i++)
         TRIX_Buffer[0]=EMPTY_VALUE;
```

Apparently you wanted to do this:

```mql5
for(int i=0;i<limit;i++)
         TRIX_Buffer[i]=EMPTY_VALUE;
```

Although when specifying:

```mql5
PlotIndexSetInteger(0,PLOT_DRAW_BEGIN,3*InpPeriodEMA-3);
```

Initialisation of the initial values can probably not be done.

You are right. We will make corrections for sure.

Initialisation should always be done. This cycle is small, it is not executed all the time, but only when the indicator is recalculated.

[Triple Exponential Average (TRIX)](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=https://commodity.com/technical-analysis/trix/ "http://www.onlinetradingconcepts.com/TechnicalAnalysis/TRIX.html")

The Triple Exponential Average (TRIX) is an indicator used to identify divergences and overbought and oversold conditions, as well as give buy and sell signals. The TRIX is helpful because it tends to filter out short-term noise.

A 9-day TRIX is shown below in the chart of the E-mini S&P 500 Futures contract:

![](https://c.mql5.com/3/22/TRIX1.gif)

**TRIX Buy Signal**

Buy when the TRIX crosses above the zero line.

**TRIX Sell Signal**

Sell when the TRIX crosses below the zero line.

The buy and sell signals are for entries. Using the above buy and sell signals for exits could prove profitless. A trader could consider exiting a long entry when the TRIX enters the oversold area and begins to turn downwards toward the zero line. Likewise, a trader could exit a short when the TRIX enters the oversold area and begins to turn upward and move toward the zero line.

Another valuable use of the Triple Exponential Average is to confirm price action or not confirm price action through divergences.

**TRIX Divergences**

The Triple Exponential Average (TRIX) is an effective indicator used to identify divergences as well as confirm price action.

* Confirmation: TRIX is rising and the price of the stock, currency, or future is rising. Likewise, when the TRIX is falling and the market price is falling.
* Divergence: TRIX is rising or neutral and the market price is falling; or TRIX is falling or neutral and the market price is rising.

Confirmations and divergences are shown below in the chart of the E-mini S&P 500 Futures contract:

![](https://c.mql5.com/3/22/TRIX2.gif)

**Low #1 to Low #2**

The E-mini S&P 500 Futures contract made a higher low and was likewise confirmed by the TRIX indicator making a higher low as well.

**High #1 to High #2**

The e-mini future managed to make higher highs; however, the Triple Exponential Average made a quite noticeable lower high and low. This bearish divergence warned that prices might change course and that traders would do well to reduce their long positions.

The TRIX making lower highs combined with the e-mini's double top formation and subsequent neckline break would also be a powerful indication that the recent price rise was likely over.

**Low #3 to Low #4**

During the S&P 500 e-mini's downtrend, it managed to make a significant lower low. In contrast, the Triple Exponential Average made equal lows, generally a sign that a price bottom was forming. Astute traders would see this TRIX divergence and would begin to buy to cover their short positions.

The Triple Exponential Average (TRIX) screens out short-term volatility and hence, is a valuable tool for medium and longer-term periods for uncovering divergences in price as well as giving easy to understand buy and sell signals.
