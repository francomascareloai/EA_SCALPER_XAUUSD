This only works for buy stops.

Don't you want to use a simpler method using the "[COrderInfo](/en/docs/standardlibrary/tradeclasses/corderinfo "Standard library: Class COrderInfo")" library instead of using "OrderGet .."?

```mql5
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
COrderInfo     InfoOrder;
```

Can you combine the counting of all types of [pending orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_type "MQL5 documentation:") (BuySell Limit, BuySell Stop) into one script? Thank you.
