Standard CCI oscillator implemented as a histogram rounding its values to the standard range:

* 1 — no rounding;
* 2 — all values divided by two;
* 5 — all values divided by five;
* 10 — all values divided by ten;
* 20 — all values divided by twenty;
* 50 — 0, 50, 100 etc.

For all CCI values less than zero, rounding occurs to the lower side, while for all CCI values exceeding zero — to the greater one.

The following input is used for rounding in the indicator:

input ENAM\_ROUND\_MODE Round=X10; // rounding level
