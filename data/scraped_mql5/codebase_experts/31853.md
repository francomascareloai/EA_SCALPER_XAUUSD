In the past 10 years of my trading, placing an order and then correcting it, the more false the wrong it will be. Let your time and talent write your EA into a one-on-one winning strategy. Ok

dear SZYMON

#could you make this ea to open buy & sell at the same time when it starts then the averaging martiangle can continue

#what is power mean ?

#what is [take profit](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7113 "Article: Scratching Profits to the Last Pip ") next position? is it take profit for all averaging open order ? since i manage to see take profit all is around 20-25 pips for all averaging position but in setting it was mentioned only 7 pips

#what is ur lot multiplier ?

because ur averaging is 0.01 - 0.01 - 0.02 - 0.03 - 0.06 etc

looking at the strategy with no strategy at all, it is ok to put in any time frame. since its not based on any indicator pure only multiplier calculation with averaging martiangle

i love it because you still can change the pipstep,initial lot.

i saw that when u are floting around 100 pips, your total lot for averaging is 0.01+0.01+0.02+0.03+0.06 = 0.13 it is fine for me

please kindly reply.. thanks for the great sharing

[Strategy - Set And Forget (with Alerting system) - MT4](/en/code/31841)

This strategy is the well known set & forget with the ALERTING system. It is very useful on different trading scenarios. I urge you guys to always use trading tools that will make your live easier. So instead of watching the charts and the time and all day long, you can use this indicator that will watch the charts for you.
