Stochastic Oscillator by William Blau is based on [Stochastic Momentum Index](/en/code/371) Indicator (see [Momentum, Direction, and Divergence: Applying the Latest Momentum Indicators for Technical Analysis](/go?link=https://www.amazon.com/Momentum-Direction-Divergence-Indicators-Technical/dp/0471027294 "http://www.amazon.com/Momentum-Direction-Divergence-Indicators-Technical/dp/0471027294")).

Stochastic Momentum Oscillator

**Calculation:**

Stochastic Momentum Oscillator is calculated as follows:

SM\_Stochastic(price,q,r,s,u) = SMI(price,q,r,s,u)  
SignalLine(price,q,r,s,u,ul) = EMA( SM\_Stochastic(price,q,r,s,u) ,ul)

where:

* SM\_Stochastic() - Stochastic Momentum Index SMI(price,q,r,s,u);
* SignalLine() - Signal Line - [exponentially smoothed moving average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") with period ul, applied to Stochastic Momentum Index;
* ul - period of EMA smoothing of a Signal Line.

**Input parameters:**

* graphic plot #0 - Stochastic Momentum Index:

+ q - period of Stochastic Momentum (by default q=5);
+ r - period of the 1st EMA, applied to Stochastic Momentum (by default r=20);
+ s - period of the 2nd EMA, applied to result of the 1st smoothing (by default s=5);
+ u ;- period of the 3rd EMA, applied to result of the 2nd smoothing (by default u=3);

* graphic plot #1 - Signal Line:

+ ul - period of EMA smoothing of a Signal Line, applied to Stochastic Momentum Index (by default ul=3);

* AppliedPrice - [price type](/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/prices) (by default AppliedPrice=PRICE\_CLOSE).

**Note**:

* q>0;
* r>0, s>0, u>0. If r, s or u =1, smoothing is not used;
* ul>0. if ul=1, the Signal Line and Stochastic Momentum Index are the same;
* Min. rates=(q-1+r+s+u+ul-4+1).

This book is a collection of exercises covering all the main topics in the modern theory of stochastic processes and its applications, including finance, actuarial mathematics, queuing theory, and risk theory.  
   
 The aim of this book is to provide the reader with the theoretical and practical material necessary for deeper understanding of the main topics in the theory of stochastic processes and its related fields.  
   
 The book is divided into chapters according to the various topics. Each chapter contains problems, hints, solutions, as well as a self-contained theoretical part which gives all the necessary material for solving the problems. References to the literature are also given.  
   
 The exercises have various levels of complexity and vary from simple ones, useful for students studying basic notions and technique, to very advanced ones that reveal some important theoretical facts and constructions.  
   
 This book is one of the largest collections of problems in the theory of stochastic processes and its applications. The problems in this book can be useful for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as for specialists in the theory of stochastic processes.
