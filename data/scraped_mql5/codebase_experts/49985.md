![Angle](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Angle.png "Angle")

The indicator calculates the angle between the trend line and the horizontal. On the X axis - minute bars are taken, regardless of the timeframe, on the Y axis - points.

[![м1](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/61.png "м1")](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/71.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/155/71.png")

Please note that local minima or maxima on the lower timeframes may not coincide with the beginning of the bar on the higher TFs.

Because of this, the indicator values may not differ significantly on different TFs.

The second variant of the indicator calculates the average rate of price change - pips/minute.

[![м1+](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/h1v.png "м1+")](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/01x.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/155/01x.png")

How to use this indicator? I don't know. Imho, absolutely useless thing.

I added a basement. However, the same useless.

I agree with you and in the description I indicated that the indicator is useless.

Although a trader I know has been trading on the indicator derived from this indicator for a long time and it is not bad.

Then why now claim it's useless? I can see a use, a sudden large angle compared to a smaller angle from a few bars previous could be a time to avoid trading, it could indicate overly volatile price action from news impact

Why useless. Well if only because nowadays to see the angle, all you have to do to see the angle is take a trendline, pull it and you will see the angle, without using an indicator.

Yes but this would only apply to manual trading. An EA isn't going to have vision like that, so these kind of indicators are food for expert advisors to help streamline risk management

Good.

I'll be glad if someone will benefit from this indicator : )

![Uniformity Factor Indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Uniformity Factor Indicator](/en/code/57975)

This is a simple analytical (non-signal, one-time calculated) indicator that allows you to test the hypothesis that price timeseries represent a "random walk", specifically Gaussian "random walk". This can help to construct a parametric transformation of price increments into evenly distributed, more stable and predictable time series, at least in terms of volatility.

![Second Bars](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Second Bars](/en/code/48962)

The indicator draws an arbitrary second timeframe on the chart.
