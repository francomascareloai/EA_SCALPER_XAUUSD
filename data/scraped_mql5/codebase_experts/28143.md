**The background :**

> In “Reflex: A New Zero-Lag Indicator” in this issue, author John Ehlers introduces a new averaging indicator that he has designed with
> reducing lag in mind. According to the author, this new indicator can be used to generate signals in a more timely manner than other
> lagging calculations. This is a continuation of hist article and is the extended TrendFlex indicator (that differs from the "reflex")
> indicator

It is a sort of a momentum like indicator and should be used like that. Default set is rather long - as usual some experimenting with the
parameters should be done prior to using it in trading decisions

Nothing to be fixed- everything that is enabled in the market watch works as expected

I'm still learning how to use MT4 in computer, sorry if I come out a little newbie on this... Good to know that the issue is on my end, any suggestion on how to fix the pairs that it doesn't [run normally](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_characteristics/matrix_norm "MQL5 Documentation: function Norm")? I deleted the indicator and re installed and nothing, still not showing up the indicator.
