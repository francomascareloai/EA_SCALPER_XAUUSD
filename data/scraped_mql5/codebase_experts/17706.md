**Input parameters**

![ivan 1.004 inputs](https://c.mql5.com/18/57/ivan_1.004_inputs.png "ivan 1.004 inputs")

* Stop Loss — the Stop Loss price level
* % risk — percentage of risk per trade based on the free margin
* Reverse Level CCI(100) — the value of the CCI(100) indicator, crossing which means a position reverse signal
* Global Signal Level CCI(100) — the value of the CCI(100) indicator, crossing which means a position opening signal
* Minimum distance from the price to stop loss (in pips) — the minimum distance between the current price and the calculated Stop Loss level
* Trailing Step (in pips) — trailing step

Various levels can be tested in the Strategy Tester to see what levels perform best. I recommend optimizing the EA in the "OHLC" mode, and then run a selected version in a single test in the "Every tick" or "Every tick based on real ticks" mode.

They say a double name gives protection against magical attacks in the market, I think the next one will be Tan and Man.

In kodobase it is not always possible to quickly post a new version, and it is not always necessary - as each version must be checked. If you are interested in the latest versions, they are always on the forum: [Ivan Advisor - the best from Ilan'a](/ru/forum/170005)
