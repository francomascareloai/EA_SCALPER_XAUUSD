My goal was to make an indicator that triggers signals when the market price cuts the moving average.

The moving average period length can be user defined (default is 200 length). The amount of points of price movement above and below the MA to be considered a signal; is also user defined in the inputs.

If shorter timeframes are used such as the 2 minute or 5 minute TF, the points number needs to be low (roughly 15 - 20) as price is moving by less points on these timeframes.

If the 1 hour timeframe or higher is used, a points number of 80 or higher should be used to smooth out the signals.

The signals are in essence based on price moving above or below the line, and the purpose of the indicator is to catch such events sooner rather than later.

### Indicator Inputs Explained

| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Moving Average Length | The period length of the moving average line. |
| Audio Alert Sample | The user defined name of the audio sample which should match the name of the actual audio sample (must be placed in data\_folder/MQL5/Files) |
| Enable Audio Alerts | Set to true or false depending on whether the indicator should trigger audio alerts |
| Amount of Points on MA Crossover | This is the user defined amount of points of price movement that should trigger signals for the bars moving over the MA |

Hi there i used your EA and tested it. i liked your idea and would be better if you improve certain things if the length of the MA would be 44 .2> if the ea not only functions on the crossover but it does when the rising graph 44MA crosses the bullish candle then buy and if the falling  graph of 44MA crosses the bearish candle then sell.setting the p/l to 2:1. I am telling this by my experience in trading, even though i started making EA on meta trader 5 some weeks ago.

Well this is just an indicator as of now not an expert. I didn't want to make this into an EA because not all signals are perfect especially if there is too much market noise. With an EA I would rather have confluence with multiple algorithms to make sure it's reliable, I think this alone is too simple to be a fully functioning EA because there is no exit signal. This indicator is only for entry signals and does not include risk management features.

This is a great little indi. (MAcrossAlerterV2).

I do wonder why you restricted it to just SMA. ?

I would have liked to use EMA.

For me the arrows are the wrong way around as I trade a bounce strategy. (Just a comment, not a critisism as this is described as a MACross indi. I can simply "no colour" the arrows)

Also there is no longer any alert info/type choice.?

For reasons unknown MACrossAlerter would not show on the charts (market currently closed so maybe it will [on Monday](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/marketinfoconstants#enum_day_of_week "MQL5 documentation: Symbol properties") ?)

This was one of my first submissions where bugs and such were not accounted for, also I could make better alert options, so I might make a new version (v3)
