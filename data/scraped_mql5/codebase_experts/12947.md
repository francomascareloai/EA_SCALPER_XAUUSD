### **No, sorry, it doesn't work**

**EA settings as is**

**Strategytester $1,000,  [x] Visual Mode,   Run Speed -------------Max.**

**EURGBP  M1 35 Trades, -$616,  H1 26 Trades -$782,  H4 55 Trades -$1,000**

**[EURUSD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/eurusd "EURUSD chart: technical analysis")  M5 235 Trades -$635,  H1 66 Trades -$673**

**Not good**

**I tried reversing \_po and \_pr in program:**

**EURUSD  H1 168 Trades went to $1324 then blew out at -$671**

**EURGBP  H1  159 Trades blew out at -$731**

**Not good**

I have tested virtually everything, all garbage. Why do people submit garbage that doesn't work??

Indicators and scripts are like hey I got ANOTHER great idea.......
