The script saves current chart settings to a template with the specified name.

There is only one **input parameter** for the template name **Name template**. The name should be specified without the ".tpl" extension. E.g. tester:

**Vladimir Karputov:**  

Or rather, you can? Example: 'EURUSD', 'EURUSD\_H1' ...

I appreciate you responding to me so quickly.  
  
I understood I can now only input name manually.  
I would very much like to have a script to read current chart symbol name automatically and use that as input for saving template

Is there a piece of code I could easily add as a noob that would make it do that?  
  
 I am sorry for taking your time, I understand it might sound silly from your perspective.

**Trendbeat :**  

I appreciate you responding to me so quickly.  
  
I understood I can now only input name manually.  
I would very much like to have a script to read current chart symbol name automatically and use that as input for saving template  
For example Ctrl+S on EURUSD and it saves a current [open chart](/en/docs/chart_operations/chartopen "MQL5 documentation: ChartOpen function") analysis as EURUSD.tpl   
As quick save in computer games.

Is there a piece of code I could easily add as a noob that would make it do that?

Hello, your script is great.

I noticed that the "id=    " in the second row in the saved template is always id=0.

When i save it by hand the template shows for example id= 5654654646513213546546

When i save it with your script, the template shows id=0 in the second row.

Is this important?

Thank you!!!

I never paid attention to it - I was always happy with everything.
