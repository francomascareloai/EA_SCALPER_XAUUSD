* ✅ Clean, non-repainting logic based on closed candles
* ✅ Suitable for scalping, swing, or trend-following strategies

#### 📊 **Use Case:**

This indicator helps traders identify potential **trend reversals** and **entry points** based on moving average crossovers while visually monitoring **volatility** and **price channels** using Bollinger Bands. It can be used as a standalone tool or combined with additional filters like RSI or CCI for more advanced setups.
