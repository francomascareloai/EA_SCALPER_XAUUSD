The Exp\_Delta\_WPR Expert Advisor is based on the [Delta\_WPR](/en/code/16499) indicator color change. A signal to perform a deal is formed at the close of a bar if the color of the indicator histogram changes to trend blue or orange.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file Delta\_WPR.ex5 in order to run. Place it to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

**Nikolay Kositsin:**  
 Make stoplosses and takeouts equal to zero.

Thanks Nikolai!

It doesn't work. Maybe I'm setting something wrong... If you have time, please take a look at the attached screens. Thank you!

Thank you Nikolai!

The whole thing is that originally everything was made for trading with only one position, and later this rule was changed. Get the TradeAlgorithms.mqh includnik from my last posts.

Everything works. Thank you very much :)

P.S. Exp\_Delta\_WPR should be recompiled for the new version of TradeAlgorithms.mqh.
