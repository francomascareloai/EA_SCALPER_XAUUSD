This is a variation of a well known perfect trend line indicator (one of the versions can be found here [PTL](/en/code/23142))

This version is adding a sort of signals filtering which helps in cleaning up some false signals that are there in the original version.

**Usage :**

* You can use the arrows (dots) as early signals
* You can use the appearance of the color candle as signal for entry or re-entry

As usual : some experimenting with the parameters is advised before using it in real trading. The defaults of the parameters are somewhat changed compared to the original (to reflect more "trendy" work) but by all means check those to adjust it to your own trading style and trading needs

Oooh, so what?

Repainting history is not a fatal error if it is intended by the developer. If you're a manual trader looking to visually inspect history, you might not like it. If you're a coder looking to build an EA, the signals appear as if you're forward testing--during an automated backtest. Therefore, the solution for the manual trader is... forward testing. Furthermore, a well strategized repainting indicator can be quite "adaptive" to current market conditions (I put adaptive in quotes because [Mladen Rakic](/en/users/mladen "mladen") actually codes non-repainting adaptive indicators as well).

Above all, try to think for yourself.  
 Nothing is totally wrong or true

Tell your "claude AI" to learn some more 😀

Maybe he/she (since I sincerely doubt that it was the "claude AI" that "told" you so) shall, eventually one fine day, learn to code
