[Multiple EA Tracking with a Magic Number Based Profit and Loss Live Dashboard in MQL5](/en/code/56409 "Multiple EA Tracking with a Magic Number Based Profit and Loss Live Dashboard in MQL5")

Whether you’re running multiple trading robots simultaneously or just one sophisticated strategy, keeping track of each Expert Advisor’s performance can be surprisingly time-consuming. MetaTrader 5 (MT5) conveniently displays orders and positions in its “Toolbox,” but when numerous robots share the same account, it becomes harder to know which EA is generating your profits—or losses. A single account might have dozens or hundreds of trades, each opened by different EAs, making it difficult to separate the results of one robot from another.

[Total Power Indicator MT5](/en/code/55519 "Total Power Indicator MT5")

Total Power Indicator (MetaTrader indicator) — is based on the two standard indicators — Bear Power and Bull Power.

[Schaff Trend Cycle MT5](/en/code/55511 "Schaff Trend Cycle MT5")

It was developed by Tom DeMark and explained in his book The New Science of Technical Analysis. The value of the indicator changes from -100 to +100. The REI is an enhanced oscillator because it tries to remain calm during the range trading and indicates signals only when the significant peaks or bottoms are spotted. You can download this indicator both for MT4 and MT5.

[Rainbow Multiple Moving Average (RMMA) MT5](/en/code/55500 "Rainbow Multiple Moving Average (RMMA) MT5")

Three alert types include: native (popup), email, and push-notification. For email and push-notification alert features to work, you need to set up the email or MetaQuotes ID settings in your MetaTrader platform options window. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.
