I am sharing these  EAs.

This is my best work till now.

the **only restriction** is that you can  use it on **CHFJPY** and **CADJPY** pair .

**Recommendations:**

* 5 min chart
* CHFJPY and CADJPY
* **IMPORTANT**:when use them live,**CHANGE the magic number** in one of two.(ex. from 4355 make it 4356)

They don't work. I back tested on CHF/JPY and it didn't place any trades. What's that about ?

It works for me- my only question is, can we add money management features? So that we can change starting lot size for risk.

I'm [backtesting](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article \"Testing trading strategies on real ticks\"") on a $10k account.
