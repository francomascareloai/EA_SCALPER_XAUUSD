#### **Main Features**

1. ---

   **Dynamic Volume Categorisation** :

   * The indicator classifies volume into various categories, assigning different colours to facilitate visual interpretation:
     + **Buying Climax**  ( clrCrimson ): Identifies moments when volume is extremely high and the price is rising.
     + **Selling Climax**  ( clrLimeGreen ): Signals moments of strong selling pressure with high volume.
     + **Churn**  ( clrGold ): Detects high volatility without a clear price direction.
     + **Climax Churn**  ( clrMagenta ): Combines buy/sell climax with churn, indicating extreme volatility.
     + **Weak Candle**  ( clrDarkTurquoise ): Identifies candles with minimal volume in the lookback window.
     + **Volume Balance**  ( clrWhiteSmoke ): Represents standard volume, with no specific characteristics that classify it in other categories. This colour is used as a "base colour" when none of the above patterns are detected.
2. ---

   **Moving Average Volume** :

   * A smoothed moving average line ( clrMaroon ) is displayed to help identify trends in volume over time.
3. ---

   **Advanced Customisation** :

   * **Moving Average Period** : Adjust the moving average period to adapt the indicator to your trading style.
   * **Lookback Window** : Set up the lookback window to compare the current volume with recent values.
   * **Volume Type** : Choose between real volume ( VOLUME\_REAL ) or tick volume ( VOLUME\_TICK ) to suit the characteristics of the asset being analysed.
4. ---

   **Clear visual interface** :

   * A coloured histogram ( DRAW\_COLOR\_HISTOGRAM ) displays the volume categories in an intuitive way, allowing for quick and efficient analysis.
5. ---

   **Flexibility for Different Timeframes** :

   * The indicator works on any timeframe, from intraday charts to weekly or monthly charts.

#### **--- How to interpret the signals**

* **Buy/Sell Climax** : Indicates moments of strong accumulation or distribution, suggesting possible trend reversals or continuations.
* **Churn** : Signalling high volatility without a clear direction, indicating uncertainty in the market.
* **Weak Candles** : Shows moments of low activity in the market, often associated with consolidations or periods of indecision.
* **Volume Balance** : Represents normal market behaviour, without significant anomalies. It is useful for identifying areas of stability.

#### **Configuration and Use**

**Better Volume**  is easy to set up and use:

1. Add the indicator to your chart in MetaTrader 5.
2. Adjust the parameters as necessary:
   * **Moving Average Period** : Sets the smoothness of the moving average line.
   * **Lookback Window** : Determines the number of candles used for comparisons.
   * **Volume Type** : Choose between real volume or tick volume.
3. Observe the signals generated by the histogram and the moving average line to make informed decisions.

#### **--- Why Use Better Volume?**

* **Volume Flow Analysis** : Better understand the behaviour of market participants based on volume.
* **Pattern Identification** : Detect buy/sell climaxes, churn and other important patterns that can influence your trading decisions.
* **Ease of Use** : The intuitive visual interface and customisation options make the indicator accessible to both beginners and experienced traders.

#### **--- Application example**

* Use the indicator to confirm entry/exit signals in volume-based strategies.

There are many implementations of the Better Volume indicator, each having different code, floating around the web.

Here's another coder's indicator to which I merely added a legend:

 This is not working. No graph is plotted, just empty window.

Hi @Sau-boon Lim  
Go to the indicator input settings and change the - Type Of volume Used from Real volume to Tick Volume.

 Good afternoon, how to set up the indicator?

You need to open the mq5 file in Meta Editor 5, then click the Compile button which should compile the mq5 indicator file to an ex5 file, it should automatically generate the file in the MT5 Platform. You should be able to locate the indicator file in the MT5 Platform indicator list of your saved indicators of your MT5 platform, look for Better volume.
