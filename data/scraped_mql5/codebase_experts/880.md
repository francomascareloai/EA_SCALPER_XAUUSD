After the huge success of my [TrendSignal indicator for MetaTrader 4](/en/code/10928) which being the top rated and the most downloaded over 90 K downloads, now I am making the same available for MetaTrader 5 enjoy.

Use on higher time frame as 1H & 4H which yields lowest risk/reward where target could be as high 200+ pips.

Hello...

I loved the [indicator](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/lines "MQL5 documentation: indicator lines"), I have always used it on MT4 now I need to use it on MT5 the problem is that there is no option to set the size of the arrow to zero (0), the arrow is too big.

The scale goes from 1 to 5.

What can I do to reduce it?

#property version "1.00"   
 #property[indicator\_chart\_window](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/lines "MQL5 documentation: indicator lines")   
 #propertyindicator\_buffers  2  
 #propertyindicator\_plots 2

another tip would be to change the arrow design there are smaller arrows and other icons in the MQL5 CODE

Good luck

Sandrolho, good evening.

What would this code be, I went there where you make the changes and it's exactly like yours.

Do you have to change anything there?

Hello...

I would very much like to know where to reduce the size of the arrow and where to cancel the [alerts](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/alert "MQL5 documentation: Alert function")?

I have always used MT4 and I could configure the size of the arrows and there were no alerts because it is very annoying that the pop up appears all the time, as shown in the attached image.

Thank you;
