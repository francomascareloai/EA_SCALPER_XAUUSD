I also tried to ask the author about errors and assignments, - silence.

From the number of monotonous indicators I realised that it is not about quality and purpose, but about the number of codes in the codeBase.

**Erm955:**  

Some errors are coming up. When compiling the TRVI indicator, the variable **limit** is not defined.

It was a strange error! But everything is fixed. You should wait a bit, the files will be changed!

**Vladon:**  

the point here is not the quality of expert-indicators, but their quantity,

there will be no answer from the author, forget it!!!

The most brazen and shameless lie! All errors are corrected very quickly and efficiently. As for the monotony, no one prevents to provide the general public with this monotony in contrast to its outstanding diversity, if it has such a place and is available! Go ahead!

I did not see these attempts! If a message appeared somewhere and it sank after the messages that followed it, and I didn't manage to notice it, what can it have to do with me? Well, if a person has claims to the fact that the world is not organised as it seems logical to him, then there are plenty of variants of such logic, and wasting time on analyses of this logic is uselessly killed time!

**GODZILLA:**  
 I didn't see those attempts! If there was a post somewhere and it sank after the posts that followed it, and I didn't notice it in time, what could it have to do with me?

nothing personal, don't mind me, maybe I'm jealous?
