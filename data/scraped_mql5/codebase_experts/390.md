2pbIdeal1MA.mq5 and 2pbIdeal3MA.mq5 indicators are the [moving averages](https://www.metatrader5.com/ru/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma) with the smoothing algorithm developed by [Neutron](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/Neutron).

In 2pbIdeal3MA.mq4 indicator this smoothing algorithm is used three times. Rough and exact types of smoothing require two input parameters each for every smoothing in the indicators. The indicators are moving averages for fixing short- and long-term trends appropriately. The simplest method of their use is based on the crossings of the slow moving average with the fast one.

This indicators were first implemented in MQL4 and published in [Code Base at mql4.com](https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/8681) 26.01.2009.

Nikolay, I see you are treading long-trodden paths and decided to express my IMHO (so that only without offence). I think you are wasting your time on different "reprises" of MA. The point is that the "standard" MA varieties included in the terminal are quite enough for any tasks. Having played with the selection of settings for the instrument and timeframe, you can get virtually any "tricky" МА-approach (in terms of drawing) out of the standard ones.

Most likely, it will not be a 100% coincidence, but in key market zones they will approximately coincide - just as standard MAs of different settings coincide in these places (including at very different periods).

This was one point, and another one is that I would refer MAs to the so-called "soft" levels, at which pip accuracy is not as important as at the "hard" breakout/breakdown levels, obtained by GA methods - hence, it follows that there is no sense to achieve "super-precision" (or "super-rightness" - I couldn't find the word).

All IMHO, IMHO and again IMHO.

Nikolay, I see you are treading the long-trodden paths and decided to express my IMHO (without offence). In my opinion, you are wasting your time on various "repetitions" of MA. The point is that the "standard" MA varieties included in the terminal are quite enough for any tasks. By playing with the selection of settings for the instrument and timeframe, you can get virtually any "tricky" МА-approach (in terms of drawing) out of the standard ones.

Most likely it will not be 100% coincidence, but in key market zones they will approximately coincide - just as standard MAs of different settings coincide in these places (including at very different periods).

This was one point, and another one is that I would refer MAs to the so-called "soft" levels, at which pip accuracy is not as important as at the "hard" breakaway/piercing levels obtained by GA methods - hence, there is no point in achieving "super-precision" (or "super-correctness" - I couldn't find the word).

All IMHO, IMHO and again IMHO.

Oh! Sir! At the moment, I am not treading the beaten path, but just converting the base of the most popular things from the MQL4 website into the MQL5 codebase. If I can do it better than others, why don't I do it? And if you think so, then why do you need this code base and MQL5 in general? Everything is already available in the Metatrader3 terminal?
