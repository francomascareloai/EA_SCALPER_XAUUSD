Keltner channel indicator with a multiplier and two ways to calculate the boundaries:  
  
     By averaging the candle body size  
     Averaging the ATR indicator data

The Keltner channel can be used as an independent indicator, but also as a source of initial data. An example is the "Squeeze Momentum Indicator" published on tradingview.com with the most likes. The translation of "Squeeze Momentum Indicator" from Pine to MQL 5 was done by me.

[Strategy - Set And Forget (with Alerting system) - MT5](/en/code/31843)

This strategy is the well known set & forget with the ALERTING system. It is very useful on different trading scenarios. I urge you guys to always use trading tools that will make your live easier. So instead of watching the charts and the time and all day long, you can use this indicator that will watch the charts for you.
