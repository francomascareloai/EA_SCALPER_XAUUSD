The entire chain: [SignalCandelsHighOpen](/en/code/16861) indicator signal module, the EA based on the signals module — [CandelsHighOpen](/en/code/16863).

If the last three bars (the zero bar is not considered) are rising:

(high[i+1]>high[i+2] && high[i+2]>high[i+3] &&   
         high[i+3]>high[i+4] && open[i+1]>open[i+2] &&   
         open[i+2]>open[i+3] && open[i+3]>open[i+4])

means the indicator generates the "+1" signal.

If the last three bars (the zero bar is not considered) are falling:

(high[i+1]<high[i+2] && high[i+2]<high[i+3] &&   
         high[i+3]<high[i+4] && open[i+1]<open[i+2] &&

means the indicator generates the "-1" signal.

If the last three bars (the zero bar is not considered) are neither rising nor falling, the signal is "0".

At the same time, the indicator has the **Reverse signals** parameter — false/true values change the signal sign:

The module of trading signals based on Candels High Open is to be created in the near future (find out more on creating trading signal modules in the article "[Create Your Own Trading Robot in 6 Steps!](/en/articles/367)"). An Expert Advisor can be generated afterwards in MQL5 Wizard based on the trading signal module.
