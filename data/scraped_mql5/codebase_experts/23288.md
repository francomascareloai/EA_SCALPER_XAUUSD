**Idea by** - [Faisal Rahman](/en/users/theclai "Faisal Rahman (theclai)")

**mq5 code author** - [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn)

The Expert Advisor operates using Buy Stop and Sell Stop orders: within the "**Number of bars**" interval, the EA searches for High and Low prices in the "**Work TimeFrame**". Then, it places pending orders at a distance from the found High and Low equal to "**Indent from High and Low**". If you enable the "**Use time control**" option, pending orders will be placed not earlier than the specified time ("**Start hour**" and "**Start minute**").

Attention: If you use "**Start minute**", it is recommended to run the EA on the M1 chart.

High and Low search is checked at the emergence of a new bar of the TF "**Work TimeFrame**", provided there are no open positions or pending orders.

When a pending order triggers, all other orders (which have not triggered) are deleted.

Launching the EA at EURUSD, M1. Optimizable parameters: "**Number of bars**" (in the range between 3 to 15, with a step of 1) and "**Work TimeFrame**" (in the range from M1 to D1). The first found good result:

A fine piece of work by Vladimir (in MT5) and Faisal Rehman (MT4). Quite good piece of work. Its sad that due to non-conventional naming the EA may not be made popular. Its a simple Candles Breakout Advance. Kudos for both. I also had an idea to shift SL to closing of second last favorable candle and after 5/6 candles same may be moved to closing of last favorable candle (add Delta in it). This strategy is much profitable than setting unknown / unspecified SL / TP. Any hope yo get same in future.???

This EA does not work with market orders. This [Expert Advisor](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_property_integer "MQL5 documentation: Order properties") places DELAYED ORDERS.
