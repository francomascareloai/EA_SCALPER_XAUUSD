This Expert Advisor is based on overbought and oversold levels.

EA will buy when RSI is in the oversold and sell when RSI is in the overbought zone.

**Update (2015.09.28):**

* TrailingStop has been added.
* TrailingStop will active ONLY IF TrailingStop>0.  

  ```mql5
  input double   TrailingStop=0;
  ```

**Update (2015.09.09):**

```mql5
input bool   OpenBUY=True;
input bool   OpenSELL=True;
input bool   CloseBySignal=True;
```

* OpenBUY, OpenSELL — now you can set for sell only or buy only or both.
* CloseBySignal — it means you must set Stop Loss and Take Profit (if ClosebySignal = false ).
