### The idea of the indicator

Display 'Arrow' in the main window if two lines intersect: 'CHO' and 'Smoothed CHO'. Version 2 has more stringent signal checking: the 'BUY' signal can only form below the zero line, and the 'SELL' signal can only form above the zero line.

Please note that this is an oscillator and two strategies can be applied:

\* apply additional filter from trend indicator

\* gain position on each signal

Hello Vladimir.

Sorry I didn't know how to explain myself in the Without shadow arrow comment.

I hope that here if you can understand me.

I have seen that in all your EAs that open positions with object signals, you can re-open the most positions, but if the first position is negative.

My question is if somehow there is an EA that opens more positions if a new [signal appears](/en/articles/2329 "Article: Signal Calculator ") and being the first position is positive as it appears in the image.

Thanks.

It is necessary to open a new position on each signal (set the '**Positions: Only one**' parameter to '***false***').

Es necesario abrir una nueva posición en cada señal (establecer el parámetro '  **Posiciones: Solo una**  ' en '  ***falso***  ').

On the contrary, I want it to open more positions, not just one, if the position of the first signal is positive and a new signal appears to open it as well.

How clumsy, I had an error in the code

if(InpLotCoefficient>0.0 && count\_sells==0 && (price\_lowest\_buy==DBL\_MAX || price\_lowest\_buy>m\_symbol.Ask()))

For this reason, he does not continue to open the other positions for me.

Excuse me grand master
