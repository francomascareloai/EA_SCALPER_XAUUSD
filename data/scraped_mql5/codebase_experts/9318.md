**Classical MACD lines with filled OSMA on the chart.**

Slow MA is calculated using ЕМА.

Histogram can be scaled by changing parameter OsmaX.

Draw buffer ordering has changed, so MACD line draws above.

OSMA indicator has added to chart.

**CoreWinTT:**  

Thanks

Hi CoreWinTT,

This is the most impressive Osma/MACD that I have found! It is my favorite indicator. Very good work...it is the best. Thank you for such an [amazing indicator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ama "MetaTrader 5 Help: Adaptive Moving Average indicator"). The impulseMACD is also cool. However, I don't use it...it overloads the senses. I don't know how to program alerts or I would add an alert so that an arrow displayed on the chart and sound is played every time the OsMA goes from positive to negative for down alert and negative to postive for up alert (in short whenever MACD crosses signal). I would be very grateful to anyone who would add such an alert to this near perfect indicator.

Best regards

gcgman
