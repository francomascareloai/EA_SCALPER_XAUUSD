### The idea of the indicator

Two iMA (Moving Average, MA) indicators ('Fast' and 'Sloe') are displayed in the main window. A color histogram ([DRAW\_COLOR\_HISTOGRAM2](/en/docs/customind/indicators_examples/draw_color_histogram2) style) can be drawn between:

1. Price <-> Fast
2. Price <-> Slow
3. Fast <-> Slow

Price type (if option '***Price <-> Fast***' and '***Price <-> Slow***' is selected) is set in '**Price:** '). You can turn on/off the display of informational Labels - they show the price of two indicators, "Fast' and 'Slow'.
