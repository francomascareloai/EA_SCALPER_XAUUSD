Add a trailing stop to your entry signals. Simply put in your entry conditions so that the **LongRule()** function returns "1" when long conditions are met and the **ShortRule()** function returns "-1" when the short conditions are met. You can set the trailing stop distance, in pips, as an external input.

Trailing stop will adjust at each tick.

![Basic Trailing Stop Inputs](https://c.mql5.com/18/42/Basic_Trailing_Stop_Inputs.png "Basic Trailing Stop Inputs")

**Recommendations:**

* Will work on 4 and 5 digit brokers.
* Always test on demo account first.
* Does not include exit logic besides Trailing Stop.
* Example strategy shown in template.

The Start, Step and Stop in the table is valid when you optimize your EA.   
For example, let say that you want to try a different range of [Take profit values](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_property_double "MQL5 documentation:") 200-1000

than,   
Start = 200

Step (the "jumps" of the values = 10 (Check each 10 points 200..210..220... )

Stop = 1000   
  
If you do wish to Optimize please read

Please change your code a little bit;

if(isPositionOpen())

should be:

if(isPositionOpen(i))

and change the [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions") to this:

bool isPositionOpen(int
i)  
  {  
 
    
return (OrderSelect(i,SELECT\_BY\_POS,MODE\_TRADES)
&& OrderMagicNumber()==magicNumber && OrderSymbol()==Symbol());  
 
}

That makes way more sense instead of the double for-lus
