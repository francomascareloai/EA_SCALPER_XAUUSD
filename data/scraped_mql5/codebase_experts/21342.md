An Expert Advisor for closing all positions, in case of the total profits on those positions exceeded the Take Profit level fixed in inputs, or where it is necessary to close all positions beyond the time interval fixed in the settings. In a manner, this EA works as a global take profit function for all open positions simultaneously.

```mql5
//+----------------------------------------------+
//|  Options to calculate the profits            |
//+----------------------------------------------+
enum TakeMode
  {
   ENUM_PERCENT,     //profits in percents of the deposit
   ENUM_CARRENCY     //profits in deposit currency units
  };
//+----------------------------------------------+
//| Input parameters of the EA indicator         |
//+----------------------------------------------+
input TakeMode LMode=ENUM_PERCENT;     //method of detecting profits
input double TakeProfit=100.0;         //take profit level
input bool   TimeTrade=true;      //Allow trading in the specified interval
```

The EA provides an option of closing positions only beyond the time interval defined in its input variables:

```mql5
input bool TimeTrade=true; //Permission to trade by time intervals
input HOURS StartH=ENUM_HOUR_0; //Trading start (Hours)
input MINUTS StartM=ENUM_MINUT_0; //Trading start (Minutes)
input HOURS EndH=ENUM_HOUR_23; //Trading end (Hours)
input MINUTS EndM=ENUM_MINUT_59; //Trading end (Minutes)
```

Two variables (hours and minutes) are provided for the operation start time, and two similar variables for the end time.

Default settings enable the Expert Advisor to trade the whole trading session from 0:00, while all positions are closed at 23:59.

If the start time is later than the specified end time, the Expert Advisor will close positions the next day, at the specified time.

The EA still won't execute when it's time, no matter if you place the order first, set it up and then run it. Or first set up and then run, and then place the order, the time still does not close the position ah.
