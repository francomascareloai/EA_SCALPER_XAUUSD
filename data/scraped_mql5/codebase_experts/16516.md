This is the " Middle-High-Low Moving Average" as described by Vitali
Apirin. It is not a single average but rather a correlation of two
averages : one being a regular average and the other is an average of
highest high and lowest low. Their crosses are showing the current
"trend". Used the default parameters proposed by Vitali Apirin — seems
that they are rather OK, except by default he is using SMA while I
decided to set EMA as the default average method, but I do recommend
some experimenting with the parameters..
