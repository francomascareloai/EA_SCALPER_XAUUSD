Dear friend

You have introduced so many of those variables that make it almost impossible to test your masterpiece, due to the slow execution.

Furthermore, I do not see your test to prove the goodness of the operation nor do I see a set file. Furthermore, you do not recommend the most suitable TF.

Your work is valuable and worth 10 with honors but your explanations are worth less than 4.

Put me in a position to test and I would be happy to help you verify that your EA matches your excellent programming skills.

Thin out the EA to speed up testing.

Bye!
