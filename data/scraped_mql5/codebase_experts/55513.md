**Spread MetaTrader indicator** — displays current spread in the main window of the chart. You can modify the font parameters, indicator's position and the normalization of the spread value. The spread is redrawn after each tick, ensuring the most current and active spread value. This can be useful for brokers with variable spreads or with spreads that are widened often. You can also enable a spread label to be shown near the current Bid line. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

## Input parameters

* **UseCustomPipSize** (default = false) — if *true*, the pip size will be based on **DecimalPlaces** input parameter, otherwise, the broker's default pip size will be used.
* **DecimalPlaces** (default = 0) — the number of decimal places in a pip. E.g. "4", if the pip looks like "0.0001".
* **AlertIfSpreadAbove** (default = 0) — if above zero, then one or more of the defined alerts will be issued if spread goes above given value.
* **AlertNative** (default = true) — if *true*, then a native popup alert will be used.
* **AlertSound** (default = false) — if *true*, then a sound alert will be played.
* **AlertEmail** (default = false) — if *true*, alerts will be sent via email. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **AlertNotification** (default = false) — if *true*, alerts will be sent via push notifications to your mobile device. Notifications should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications*.
* **DrawLabel** (default = false) — if *true*, a small text label with the current spread value will be drawn near the Bid line.
* **font\_color** (default = Red) — color of the spread indicator.
* **font\_size** (default = 14) — size of the spread indicator.
* **font\_face** (default = "Arial") — font of the spread indicator.
* **corner** (default = ANCHOR\_LEFT\_UPPER) — location for the spread indicator on the chart.
* **spread\_distance\_x** (default = 10) — horizontal distance from the corner to indicator.
* **spread\_distance\_y** (default = 130) — vertical distance from the corner to indicator.
* **DrawTextAsBackground** (default = false) — if *true*, the text label with the spread value will be drawn as background. It can be useful if you want to prevent the indicator from obscuring the chart.
* **label\_font\_color** (default = Red) — color of the spread label.
* **label\_font\_size** (default = 13) — size of the spread label.
* **label\_font\_face** (default = "Courier") — font of the spread label.

![Schaff Trend Cycle MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Schaff Trend Cycle MT5](/en/code/55511)

Schaff Trend Cycle (MetaTrader indicator) — is a cyclical oscillator created by calculating the stochastic over stochastic over a MACD line using cycles. The result is the improved version of the oscillator that is not choppy during the trends and reacts to the changes very fast. It was developed by Doug Schaff, who assumed that the currency trends accelerate and decelerate in cycles. Its algorithm was made public in 2008. Schaff Trend Cycle tries to combine two different methods of determining the trend direction changes — MACD and smoothed stochastic oscillator. The value of the indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. Two trigger levels are used — 25 and 75. Optional alerts are available. You can download this indicator for MT4, MT5

![RSIOMA MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[RSIOMA MT5](/en/code/55509)

RSIOMA MetaTrader indicator — this indicator takes two moving averages, calculates their RSI (Relative Strength Index) and then also adds a moving average of the calculated RSI. These two lines now can accurately signal the trend changes. They are shown in the separate window where they change from 0 to 100. The auxiliary histogram is shown for a quick-glance view of the current trend. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5 versions of the MetaTrader platform.

![Support and Resistance MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Support and Resistance MT5](/en/code/55515)

Support and Resistance MetaTrader indicator — as the name of this indicator suggests, it displays the support and resistance levels. It shows them directly on the chart, providing an easy help when you want to set stop-loss or take-profit level, or when you want to see the next market target. This indicator uses the standard MetaTrader Fractals indicator (by Bill Williams' method) and has no changeable input parameters. This indicator is available for MetaTrader version 4 and 5.

[Coppock MT5 indicator](/en/code/55371)

Coppock MetaTrader indicator — is an implementation of the famous Coppock curve indicator first created by Edward Coppock in 1962. The indicator shows long-term buy and sell opportunities (classically, it is used for only buying) by measuring the weighted moving average (with a period of 10) of the sum of two rates of change (with a period of 14 and 11). It is the classical version. In this MetaTrader version, you can modify the parameters of the basic indicators. You can use this Coppock indicator in MT4 and MT5.
