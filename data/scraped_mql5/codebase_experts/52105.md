### 

#### Key Features:

* **Signal Detection:** Identifies oversold (RSI < 30) and overbought (RSI > 70) conditions with engulfing patterns for optimal entry points.
* **Dynamic Risk Management:** Uses the Average True Range (ATR) to adjust stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop levels, adapting to market conditions.
* **Spread Filter:** Avoids trading in high-spread conditions for better risk control.
* **Visual Indicators:** Displays buy (green arrow) and sell (red arrow) signals on the chart for easy monitoring.

#### Recommended Symbols:

* **Forex:** Major pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CHF.
* **Crypto:** Liquid cryptocurrencies such as BTC/USD and ETH/USD.

#### Recommended Parameters for M1 Trading:

* **InpPeriodRSI = 6** : A quick RSI for rapid market movements.
* **InpMAPeriod = 2** : Short-period moving average for trend detection.
* **MaxSpread = 15-20 points** : Prevents trading during high spread conditions.
* **InpLot = 0.01** : Start with a low lot size for safer trading on the 1-minute chart.

#### Getting Started:

1. Adjust the parameters based on your trading style and market conditions.
2. **Test on a demo account** first with recommended symbols to understand the EA's behavior and optimize settings.
3. Monitor performance and refine parameters if needed for the best results.

This EA is simple, adaptable, and suitable for both beginners and experienced traders looking for automated, short-term trading strategies.

 I'm no stranger to creation of EA's as I made several - but just looking at the code, this won't trade, there's no logic for signaling a position open. The logic to execute a position is fine, but no logic included there to signal a position. I'm not sure if that's intentional or not

this is no robot at all ! Lol...  It just draw Arrows on the chart, based on the indicators output.

Hello. It does not open trades before. I add code of buy trade, only one trade per bar when signal is on. But can not code sell trade, because it does not give [sell signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/591 "Article: How to Become a Signal Provider for MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 ") and does not draw sell arrow.

Yeah, there are some valuable *de facto*"indicators" coded as EA's but in the Author's case here, the following is a bit misleading:

"This EA is simple, adaptable, and suitable for both beginners and experienced traders looking for automated, short-term trading strategies."
