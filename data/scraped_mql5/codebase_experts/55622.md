This is simply an indicator that professionally instantiates a moving average, and makes the code very portable so that it can be copied and pasted into bigger indicator projects.

It's educational code for beginners. In one script the moving average is calculated from oldest to newest data, in the series version the moving average is calculated from the most recent data to oldest data.

The moving average is calculated in one function call inside OnCalculate. There is nothing amazing about this, it's just to create organization and portability. You can do this with any of the mql indicator functions.

[Total Power Indicator MT5](/en/code/55519)

Total Power Indicator (MetaTrader indicator) — is based on the two standard indicators — Bear Power and Bull Power. The indicator calculates how many bullish and bearish bars were there during a given look-back period and then calculates the proportional index for bears, bulls, and total (calculated as the absolute difference between bulls and bears) for the current bar. This way, we get continuous lines of the relative average bear and bull power over a period, removing the main disadvantage of the original Bear/Bull Power indicators — the lack of a long-term perspective. The original MetaTrader 4 version of Total Power Indicator was created by Daniel Fernandez of Asirikuy.com in 2011. The version for MT5 is now also available.
