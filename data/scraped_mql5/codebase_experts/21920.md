Renko charts are built on custom symbols. The EA automatically creates a custom symbol. The EA works on tick history. Renko chart features tick and real volume (if any). The chart is built based on either Last or Bid price.

The chart works in real time mode when the EA is running. An obtained symbol can be used in the tester but only on Open prices and every tick.

Important! The chart is displayed correctly on М1 only.

It is not working, I have tried checking in IDE and it is throwing error, please check I have even created a folder as customsymbols in Include folder and attached the CustomSymbols file, there is no error in [Custom symbols](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/3540 "Article: Creating and Testing Custom Symbols in MetaTrader 5 ") file
error exists in the main code (RenkoChart)
