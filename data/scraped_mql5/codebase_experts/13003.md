The Exp\_BlauTVI Expert Advisor is based on signals generated by the [BlauTVI](/en/code/11437) trend indicator. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if the indicator histogram changes direction.

This Expert Advisor requires BlauTVI.ex5 compiled indicator file in order to run. Place it in <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
