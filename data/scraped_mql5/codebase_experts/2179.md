Smooth Stochastic. After the main and signal lines of the [Stochastic](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so") are calculated, their values are filtered by the averaging algorithm for a better directive effect.

The indicator uses SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library classes (must be copied to the terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Include). The use of the classes was thoroughly described in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).

Originally this indicator has been written in MQL4 and was first published in the [Code Base](/en/code/7432) on 01.01.2007.
