### **MA of Custom RSI | Smart Momentum Filter**

**Tired of noisy RSI signals?** Transform your momentum analysis with the **MA of Custom RSI** indicator. This powerful tool filters the classic RSI through a moving average, providing a smoother, more reliable signal line for pinpointing entries, exits, and trend direction with unparalleled clarity.

**Perfect for traders who:**

* Struggle with false signals from a choppy, fast-moving RSI.
* Want a clearer, more defined view of momentum shifts.
* Use strategies based on RSI but need a more robust and tradable signal.

---

### **✨ Key Features & Benefits**

* **Dual-Layer Analysis**: Plots both the raw **Custom RSI (period 1)** and a smoothed **Moving Average of the RSI** on the same window, giving you both the raw speed and the filtered trend.
* **Unmatched Customization**:

  + **Custom RSI Core**: Utilizes MetaTrader 5's built-in custom RSI, allowing for extreme settings like period 1 for ultra-sensitive readings.
  + **Fully Configurable MA**: Choose the MA **Period**, **Method** (SMA, EMA, LWMA, SMMA), and **Shift** to lead or lag the signal precisely to your strategy's needs.
* **Clear Visual Guidance**: Customizable overbought and oversold levels (default: 80/15) are displayed as horizontal lines, making reversals and extremes instantly recognizable.
* **Professional Design**: Clean, intuitive visuals with a solid line for the MA and a dotted line for the underlying RSI, all in a separate window scaled perfectly from 0 to 100.

---

### **🛠 How It Works & Trading Ideas**

The indicator calculates a standard RSI and then applies your chosen moving average to those RSI values itself. This creates a "signal line" that filters out market noise.

**Popular Trading Strategies:**

* **MA Crossover**: Enter long when the fast RSI line crosses *above* its MA, and short when it crosses *below*.
* **Trend Confirmation**: Stay in a trade only while the RSI remains *above* its MA in an uptrend or *below* it in a downtrend.
* **Divergence Detection**: Spot classic RSI divergences against price, but use the smoother MA line for clearer, more reliable confirmation.
* **Level Rejection**: Look for the RSI and its MA to bounce off the overbought/oversold levels for high-probability reversal signals.

---

### **⚙️ Input Parameters**

Tailor every aspect of the indicator to fit your unique style:

* **RSI Settings**: Period, Applied Price.
* **MA Settings**: Period, Shift, Method (SMA, EMA, LWMA, SMMA).
* **Level Settings**: Fully adjustable Overbought and Oversold levels

---

### **📋 Requirements**

* MetaTrader 5
* The standard **Examples\RSI.ex5** indicator must be present in your  MQL5/Indicators/Examples/  directory (it is included by default with MT5).
