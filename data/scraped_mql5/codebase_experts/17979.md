Where is it written that the script opens positions? Where? The script places an order, determining the size of the lot so as to spend on it the appropriate share of the deposit. If you don't like it, look for another script.

I wanted to swear at first :) It's not that I don't like it, I just want to understand how it works!!!! Ok, let the deposit is 1000$, I put 0,1 mm, i.e. the script lets 100$ into the order, I want a profit of 100 pips[(five digits](/en/docs/check/digits "MQL5 documentation: Digits function")), how much will it be in evergreen?

Just any script cannot give more than what it can give and this script is not an exception. It has no such functionality. You should go to Freelance. What's that got to do with me? It's a rather costly activity - programming.
