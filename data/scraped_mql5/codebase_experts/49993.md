If there are objects cluttering the chart, sometimes you might want to start afresh without having to delete the entire chart and load another one.

This means it may be efficient to drag a script onto the chart in order to clean it. Like a "clear" or "cls" but for objects.

It should be placed in *MQL5/Scripts*
