Simple indicator that will scan thru the symbols in the MarketWatch window to alert you if price is overbought or oversold based on RSI.

You can use a pop up alert or send to phone.

Not possible! The mobile app does not support custom indicators nor any type of MQL program.

[@smalumbete](/en/users/smalumbete)  You can receive mobile notifications by either setting the indicator on VPS or keeping your laptop/computer running at home and then setting 'UseNotification' to True in the indicator. Go to MT4 Options > Notifications > Enable Push Notification and add the MetaQuoteID, which is available on your mobile phone's MT4 app Messages tab. Now, you should receive notifications. You can also search for 'How to Send MT4 Indicator Alerts to Your Mobile Phone' on YouTube.

The trade strategy is based on 2 moving averages. To confirm the trend, it uses 2 moving averages crossing and 1 candlestick formation while the moving averages are still crossed.
