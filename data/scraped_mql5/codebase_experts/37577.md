how to adjust order lots plz

```mql5
int li_Ticket1 = OrderSend(_Symbol,OP_SELL,1,Bid,10,ld_stoplossSell,ld_takeprofitSell,NULL,1212);


int li_Ticket2 = OrderSend(_Symbol,OP_BUY,1,Ask,10,ld_stoplossBuy,ld_takeprofitBuy,NULL,1122);
```

line no 69 and line no 92

You can change the lot size which is the third parameter which is set to 1 by default. you can change "1". to something else like   0.1.

After making the change you beed to recompile the code.
