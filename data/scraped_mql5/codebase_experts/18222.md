**Author**:

The system is not mine, it was described by Chuck LeBo and David Lucas.

This EA uses the following purchase rules:

1. MA\_Long should go up - this is a filter.

2 The closing price must cross from the bottom to the top of the upper Bollinger Boundary (BB\_Up).

3 When buying, set the stop at the lower Bollinger Border minus the reserve points.

Exit:

When crossing the price of closing the middle Bollinger line from top to bottom.

The GBPUSD, H1 pair is recommended.

2. The [closing price](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/prices#enum_applied_price_enum "MQL5 Documentation: Price constants") should cross the upper Bollinger line (BB\_Up) from bottom to top.

...................

Exit the position when the closing price crosses the middle Bollinger line from top to bottom.

-----------------------------------------  
 How does the closing price cross the line ?  
 M.b. MA on closing price crosses the line ?
