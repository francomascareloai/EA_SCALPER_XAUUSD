A Donchian Channel Strategy breakout EA. Best results at H1.

Strategy and input parameters fully described in the video here below

So far it can be used in many pairs. Actually I suggest the following:

1. Run optimizations on as many pair as possible within the last 6 months

2. Repeat the optimizations every month

3. Attach all the profitable sets to the charts in order to maximize the profit and spread the risk

At this time I'm using those sets on an account balance of 500€

To run the optimizations I follow the approach shown on this video (let me know if you need me to create a more detailed or specific video)

Hi, I found this code very interesting and I am running some tests on 1hr on Nasdaq with some adjustments. I'd like to review the [take profit](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7113 "Article: Scratching Profits to the Last Pip ") logic to look for some improvements but the code is to complex and long for me to intervene. It would be useful to share the logic of the TP. Many thanks to the authgor for the super job he did! Keep up with the good work! Puma (Paolo)
