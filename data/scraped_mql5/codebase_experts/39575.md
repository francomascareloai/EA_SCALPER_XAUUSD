Hi

I could not locate how to use it.

![VIDYA N Bars Borders](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[VIDYA N Bars Borders](/en/code/39574)

iVIDYA (Variable Index Dynamic Average) indicator with levels for N bars

![Group transfer Stop loss](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Group transfer Stop loss](/en/code/39564)

The script (not an Expert Advisor) sets and moves the Stop Loss for all positions on the current symbol to the specified price

![AMA Trader 2](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[AMA Trader 2](/en/code/39582)

Trading strategy based on the iAMA (Adaptive Moving Average, AMA) and iRSI (Relative Strength Index, RSI) indicator. Doubling the position at a loss (not Martingale!)

![DeMarker Pending 2_5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[DeMarker Pending 2\_5](/en/code/39591)

Finalization of previous version. Now, when opening a 'SELL' position, we immediately close all 'BUY' positions and vice versa: when opening a 'BUY' position, we immediately close all 'SELL' positions
