Original of this one was posted here : [ATR adaptive smooth Laguerre RSI](/en/code/22730). This version is a version that is a part of optimization

- atr calculation is done internally (not using built in atr)
- smoothing is done using built in averages functions though - simply to allow more smoothing modes

**Recommendations:**

* Since the false signals are lessened in this smoothed version, you can use it like any other RSI and Laguerre RSI indicator - but with less false signals
