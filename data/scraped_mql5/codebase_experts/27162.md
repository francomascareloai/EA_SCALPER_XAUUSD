Two variations are available;

### **[ScalpAll]**

* this script opens random positions with multiple symbols on marketwatch.
* take-profit and stop-loss levels are calculated by multiplying current spread with "Take Profit Ratio" and "Stop Loss Ratio" respectively.
* count of trades to be opened can be limited by "Maximum Trades".
* only symbols having spread below "Maximum Spread" are considered.

### **[ScalpRandom]**

* this script opens a random position with single symbol that is selected randomly on marketwatch.
* take-profit and stop-loss levels are calculated in same way with ScalpAll. maximum spread limitor is also available.

### **[CloseScalps]**

* this script closes scalping positions tagged with magic number 999.
* only positions in profit can be closed by setting relevant input to true.
