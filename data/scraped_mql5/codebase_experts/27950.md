Trading the **STRONG** against the **weak**!

The Currency Strength Index (CSI) is a technical indicator to chart the strength momentum of the 8 major currencies. (EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, USD, CAD, CHF, JPY)

The indicator is based on mathematical decorrelation of 28 cross currency pairs.

It uses the percentage difference in Linear-weighted averaging (LWMA) of the closing prices.

### 

### **Basic idea**

If X/Y currency pair is in an uptrend, it shows if it is due to X strength or Y weakness.

Imagine what it would be like to monitor the performance of all 28 currency pairs on one chart.

To see instantly which pairs are trending, and if so how strongly.

Advantages for trading strategies

* Currency Strength Index (CSI) can be used as a support indicator for technical analysis.
* It is an information indicator to realize which currencies are trending, this is an ideal indicator for trend follow traders.
* It helps scalpers looking for strength trend.
* It is an instrument for correlation traders to see reactions of each currencies on moves in correlated instruments.
* It is a single indicator with which you can observe most of the Forex market in one chart.
* Currencies and currency pairs move constantly from one to the other in all timeframes.
* It helps you to identify the strongest/weakest currencies so you can pick the right currency pair to trade
* Finally, the indicator will also help you to monitor current positions, with the indicator showing you when a currency has moved from one extreme to another and perhaps signalling a potential reversal in the opposite direction.

### 

### Installation:

The Currency Strength Index (CSI) can be applied to any chart for any currency pair.

The chart does not influence or affect the appearance or performance of the indicator.

For example you can apply the indicator to a GBP/USD, a EUR/USD, or a USD/CHF, or any other pair.

The indicator will display in an identical way on each chart.

On the first time, you may need to  **switch the chart timeframe a few times** to allow all the indicator data to load.

### Trading ideas:

Currencies that are significantly sloping away from each other are candidates for trend trading.

Currencies that run paralel to each other are ranging and can be traded from the top of a band or channel to the bottom with confidence.

Using the indicator in multiple timeframes is an excellent way to see whether a currency is rising or falling across several timeframes, adding a further dimension to your analysis, and allowing you to quantify the risk on any trade in a more detailed way.

### Remember:

The Currency Strength Index (CSI) doesn’t tell you when to enter a trade, it only helps you to filter for potential currency pairs to trade.

You can tweak the Currency Strength Index (CSI) to adapt to different trading timeframes.

**amrali [#](/en/forum/332835/page2#comment_47820049):** Inactivity of a currency is not a missing bar. It is a bar with its open, high, low and close are the same value. This will be represented like a "dash" on the chart of lower time frames.

No, that is incorrect. When there is no tick activity, then no bar is formed. The bar will be missing. This I can guarantee.

Analyse some low activity symbols at low time-frames and you will find that happening.

A very simple example that illustrates this is weekends and special holidays.

**amrali [#](/en/forum/332835/page2#comment_47820049):** So, for this inactive period of trading, the strength of this currency should be the same, and I think this is the correct behavior.Imagine a currency whose price is not moving for a long period of time, its moving average line should coincide with its price line.

In CSI, time shifts are applied on the standard moving average indicator, not on the price data itself.

Even if the moving average does not change for the missing time, when calculating the Currency Strength, if you don't align things, then you are mixing apples and oranges.

Your idea is very good but you need to re-write your indicator because right now your are mixing data because no garanty that for 1 index you will have the same timestamp for each symbol. For solving the problem you need to get timestamp corresponding to the current symbol in using function: datetime currentTime = iTime(\_Symbol,PERIOD\_CURRENT,i);
Then for each symbol, you can call function iBarShift(symbols[i],PERIOD\_CURRENT,currentTime,true);
Like that you will not have any risk to mix different timestamp. Also you have a tipo mistake at line 103. You should have #define [USDCAD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/usdcad "USDCAD chart: technical analysis") 25

Thank you for developing this awesome indicator. I noticed that when you turn off some currency, it still shows in the indicator. It seems to be resource intensive when everything is turned on hence I turn off those that I do not trade.
