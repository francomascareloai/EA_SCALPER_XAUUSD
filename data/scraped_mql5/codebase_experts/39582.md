Version 2 added ' **Time control** ' group and removed ' **Profit limit for close all** ' and ' **Withdrawal** ' parameters. Added trailing lot size control (description of new functions is in the [RSI Dual Cloud EA](/en/code/39497) code).

Checking the trading signal - only at the moment of the birth of a new bar.

When generating a trading signal, the Expert Advisor considers two indicators: iAMA (Adaptive Moving Average, AMA) and iRSI (Relative Strength Index, RSI). The signal itself is created in two steps. On the example of the "Open Buy" signal:

![AMA Trader](https://c.mql5.com/18/104/AMA_Trader.png "AMA Trader")

Step 1: RSI Must be below level 30 (this level in the EA is set in the parameter   **RSI Level Down** ). Step 2: The price must overcome the AMA indicator. To search for the optimal combination of two indicators, the **Step Length** parameter is introduced   - distance in bars between Step 1 and Step 2.

**Martingale**

When a trading order is received, we separately request profit for BUY positions and SELL positions. If a trade order is received:

* "Open Buy"

+ if profit on BUY positions is less than 0.0 - open two BUY positions
+ otherwise open one BUY position

* "Open Sell"

+ if profit on SELL positions is less than 0.0 - open two SELL positions
+ otherwise open one SELL position

Is it possible to tweak the adviser a little? Add a martingale function for the next RSI signal. Because the adviser gives good results on the test. Otherwise, it opens several deals in one place

Finalization of previous version. Now, when opening a 'SELL' position, we immediately close all 'BUY' positions and vice versa: when opening a 'BUY' position, we immediately close all 'SELL' positions
