This is an example of use of the **OBJPROP\_XOFFSET** and **OBJPROP\_YOFFSET** properties. See video: [https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/3509/page1#comment\_55145](/en/forum/3509/page1#comment_55145).

This feature will allow you to use the image with a set of several images (like CSS-sprites used in web).

![Demo_BitmapOffset (OBJPROP_XOFFSET and OBJPROP_YOFFSET)](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/Demo_Offset.png "Demo_BitmapOffset (OBJPROP_XOFFSET and OBJPROP_YOFFSET)")

**Important:** To use the OBJPROP\_XOFFSET and OBJPROP\_YOFFSET properties you must specify the size of the visible area using the [OBJPROP\_XSIZE and OBJPROP\_YSIZE](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object_property) properties.

To compile the script, unpack the file from the archive files.zip to the **terminal\_data\_folder**\MQL5\Files\.

To launch the compiled version (Demo\_BitmapOffset.ex5) of the script, download it and place to the **terminal\_data\_folder**\MQL5\Scripts\.

**Recommendations:**

* The use of the [resources](/en/articles/261) allows to serve all the necessary objects in a single .EX5 file.

```mql5
//--- find out the size of the loaded image to set the size of the scope correctly
   long y_size=ObjectGetInteger(0,bitmap_label,OBJPROP_YSIZE);

   long visual_y_size=y_size/3;
//--- set the width of the scope equal to the width of the loaded image
   ObjectSetInteger(0,bitmap_label,OBJPROP_YSIZE,visual_y_size);
```

Such change of OBJPROP\_YSIZE-property completely deprives the normal possibility to find out the height of the source image?

Now, to find out the size of a (custom) resource in a BITMAP-object, you need to create an auxiliary graphic object of the same size on the basis of OBJPROP\_BMPFILE-source and read OBJPROP\_XSIZE/OBJPROP\_YSIZE properties in it, deleting then the temporary object.

Isn't that too crutchy?
