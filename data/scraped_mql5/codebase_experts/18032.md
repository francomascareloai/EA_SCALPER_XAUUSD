Smoother (some know it as Jurik smoother) that is made adaptive using deviations.

Deviations used for adapting in this version can have two "flavors":

* without sample correction (same as built in standard deviation)
* with sample correction

Coloring is made using gradient colors, but you can have the usual coloring modes too.

* for single color line set the color steps to 1
* for two colors line (changing colors on a slope) set the color steps to 2
* any other higher number of steps makes a nice gradient coloring of the line
