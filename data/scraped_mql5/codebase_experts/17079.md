Increasing the lot after a losing trade. OnTradeTransaction. Entry signals are based on the DeMarker indicator.

Expert Advisor Input Parameters

* p — period for the DeMarker oscillator Optimized with the values from 3 to 100 with step of 1.
* tp — take profit in pips. Optimized with the values from 10 to 100 with step of 1.
* sl — stop loss in pips. Optimized with the values from 10 to 100 with step of 1.
* lots — lot size of the first order and all orders opened after a losing trade. The parameter is not optimized.
* mn — magic number. The parameter is not optimized.
* losseslimit — limit the number of losing trades in a row. The parameter is not optimized. In case the number of losses reaches a limit, the EA stops opening new trades and sends a message e-mail.

Lot increase ratio is calculated by the formula:

double k=(ExtTakeProfit+ExtStopLoss)/(ExtTakeProfit-spread);

The EA works only at newly formed bars and opening prices. There is no need to optimize it using Every tick mode.
