No. It is based on the previous candle. Used as confirmation.

Interesting that the colouring looks "obviously correct" although you are not using symmetric conditions for painting candles blue or red:

```mql5
if(... || (MathMin(haClose, haOpen) < haLow)  ) { ExtColorBuffer[i] = 1.0; } // red if no lower shadow
if(... || (MathMax(haClose, haOpen) < haHigh) ) { ExtColorBuffer[i] = 0.0; } // blue if upper shadow
```

I'm curious. Where did you find the conditions for the HA colours?

Wouldn't we expect

```mql5
ExtColorBuffer[i] = (haClose > haOpen) ? 0.0 : ( (haClose < haOpen) ? 1.0 : 2.0)
```

similarly to Heikin Ashi Colors (HAC) [cI8DH] - TradingView or [HeikinAshi\_SepWnd](/en/code/1269)?

Otherwise, I consider this a great example for a coding style to be desired.

Well, I developed them myself, haven't found them anywhere, to be honest.

But thank you for the flowers.

Take a close look at how price values are compared, you will see, there is no "gap" in between, although I don't remember the code by heart. I know, I code (usually) complete.

You know what, I think you are right, I can't [check](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/integration/python_metatrader5/mt5ordercalcmargin_py "MQL5 Documentation: order_calc_margin function") right now, but there seems to be a typo.

This

(MathMin(haClose, haOpen) < haLow)

Should be this

(MathMin(haClose, haOpen) > haLow)

But I am not sure....

This is a helper indicator which allows you to adjust vertical scale of a subwindow manually, which is useful for zooming in and zooming out graphs of your favourite indicator placed in the same subwindow.
