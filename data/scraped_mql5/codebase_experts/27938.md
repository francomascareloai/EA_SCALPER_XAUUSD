This Expert Advisor shows that you can make a profitable automated trading robot using technical analysis and not too many rules. Only prices (to
determine Doji) and a single indicator (ATR) is used. No extra files or custom indicators are necessary.  
  
The EA is designed for the
Daily time frame because technical analysis of candlesticks works best at higher time frames.
