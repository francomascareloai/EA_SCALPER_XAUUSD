Let say you have an EA and you want it to trade in between an interval of time but you do not have the source codes to modify the EA.

This utility allows you to automatically enable or disable the automated trading button. You can use the codes as an EA, Indicator or script but
I used as an EA.

**Recommendations:**

* You need to uncomment 4 lines of codes where is written uncomment
* You can remove Ordersend command because I set it only for the codes to past the test but it is meaningless.
* You add minutes for to the codes
* You can modify and insert it on your EA, Indicator

**Input parameters:**

* Start AutoTrade Time
* Stop AutoTrade Time

**Automated-Trading:**  

[Automatically enable or disable the automated trading button](/en/code/26270):

Author: [Mafuta Landou](/en/users/lpelanjie "lpelanjie")

Hey that is such a great tool. Since it uses windows library and windows function PostMessageA(),  
Can you please guide me as to how to figure out which commands will help perform which function so i can further explore on my own since things like Enabling/Disabling auto trading can't be accomplished using mql native functions

Is there an specific code to turn on Autotrading and Turn off inside my EA without need of human intervention nor click any button?

Arrow trends by iBearsPower and iBullsPower indicator for MT4.

![Evenly weighted DXY and changeable base currency](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Evenly weighted DXY and changeable base currency](/en/code/26287)

Currency Index that calculates evenly on all 7 major pairs. Can also change base currency. Based on No Nonsense Forex podcast.

![Overlay Chart Modified to not repaint on each bar](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Overlay Chart Modified to not repaint on each bar](/en/code/26289)

Used to compare 2 currencies on one chart, the Original indicator will recenter its calculation on every bar, and hence the price will keep shifting up and down and so the historical relative values do not remain constant. This indicator was modified so that the 'center' or initial relative reference point stays fixed and does not update each bar. It will only reinitialize when the indicator is reloaded or settings are changed.
