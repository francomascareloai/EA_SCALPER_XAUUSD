**nail sertoglu :**  

THX for your shared codes..

But when I tried the application on test and did not see any difference following ones

    they show same equal values for the following ones get from iStochasticGet , since they have ZERO within the paranthesis

   sig\_buy  = iStochasticGet(SIGNAL\_LINE,0);    
   sig\_sell = iStochasticGet(SIGNAL\_LINE,0);

for example if sig\_buy is equal to 69 and  s ig\_sell is equal to 69 ALSO ?!?!?!

 

 and same equal values for the following ones get from iRSIGet, since they have ZERO within the paranthesis  
   sig\_high = iRSIGet(0);  
   sig\_low  = iRSIGet(0);

What should I do to cause to show them different values ?

In the [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions") ' iStochasticGet' and in the function ' iRSIGet', the value '0' is the number of the bar. To determine the signal, the value of indicators on the bar '0' is interrogated.

with the following sentences seen at attached print screen from your code when they gave the same values how can we compare to decide to get buy or sell signal ?

I tried to revised the application file ( attached ) according to other related codes ; since I am not experienced in mql 5 coding, please correct me , thanks in advance .

Read the code of the adviser. Everything is clear in the code. There are no "equal values."

![Gandalf_PRO](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Gandalf\_PRO](/en/code/17187)

The creation of the Expert Advisor stems from the topic "Neural networks - where to start studying them".

![JK BullP AutoTrader](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[JK BullP AutoTrader](/en/code/17185)

The Expert Advisor uses the iBullsPower (Bulls Power) indicator.

![Hercules A.T.C. 2006](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Hercules A.T.C. 2006](/en/code/17195)

The Expert Advisor trades moving average breakouts. It uses the following indicators: two iMAs (Moving Average, MA), iRSI(Relative Strength Index, RSI) and two iEnvelopes (Envelopes).
