![Adaptive CCI](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Adaptive CCI](/en/code/62155)

Adaptive CCI - Commodity Channel Index with dynamically adjusting upper and lower limits based on market volatility. Eliminates fixed thresholds (like 100/-100) by using EMA-smoothed peaks and troughs, providing more reliable overbought/oversold signals tailored to each asset's current volatility. Perfect for identifying high-probability reversal points with adaptive confirmation levels.

Perfect for identifying reversal points with greater reliability.
