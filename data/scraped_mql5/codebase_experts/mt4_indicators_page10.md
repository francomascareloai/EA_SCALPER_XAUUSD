/\* Changelog
2-4-19 Added 50% line to indicator box
- Ignored changing the indicator lines individually since mql does not have a built-in language convention to create this change would require too much additional research and effort.
Fixed error with the DodgerBlue lines not showing, the problem was due to using DodgerBlue instead of clrDodgerBlue in the code to indicate color, should be fixed now.
