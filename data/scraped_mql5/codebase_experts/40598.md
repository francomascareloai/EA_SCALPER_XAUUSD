The same code can be compiled in mt4 as well. It gets News from FXStreet servers automatically which can be further filtered by importance level, Currency and Keyword in the News.

Mt5 version can be found here:

Thanks Muhammad saved me a lot of time coding . some problems, it only reads every second item, it skips the odd rows so a bit of coding needed , then the fxstreet service seems to be a free demo service and the news has some demo items added so not accurate from what im seeing. trying to get to the bottom of this. any suggestions? already told people news is coming lol

Time segmented volume (TSV) is a technical analysis indicator developed by Worden Brothers Inc. that segments a stock’s price and volume according to specific time intervals. The price and volume data is then compared to uncover periods of accumulation (buying) and distribution (selling).
Time Segmented Volume was developed by Worden Brothers, Inc to be a leading indicator by comparing various time segments of both price and volume.
