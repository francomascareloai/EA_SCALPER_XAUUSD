![Recursive Moving Average](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Recursive Moving Average](/en/code/38598)

Recursive Moving Average calls itself a number of times in order to reach the appropriate smoothing. For instance DEMA,TEMA and Rainbow indicators are recursive exponential moving averages. The goal is to remove the loop limit while still running fast. In addition a trigger line provides the trading signal.
