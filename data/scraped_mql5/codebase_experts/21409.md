Three independent trading systems using [ColorJFatl\_Digit](/en/code/15735 "AbsolutelyNoLagLWMA - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicators within a single EA with an ability to change the volume of a forthcoming trade depending on the results of the previous trades for this trading system. Trading signals are formed when a bar closes if a trend has changed (which is displayed by any of the three indicators changing its color).

The blocks of input EA variables are added for managing volumes of opened positions. For example, for the first system:

```mql5
input uint    A_BuyLossMMTriger=2;  //A number of loss-making Buy trades to decrease MM
input uint    A_SellLossMMTriger=2; //A number of loss-making Sell trades to decrease MM
input double  A_SmallMM=0.01;       //A Share of financial resources from the deposit used in a trade in case of losses
input double  A_MM=0.1;             //A Share of financial resources from the deposit used in a trade in case of normal trading
```

In case of such inputs and if the last two trades in one direction were loss-making, the EA opens the next trade in the same direction having the volume of 0.01 lot. If at least one of the two last trades is not loss-making, the position volume is 0.1.

The similar inputs are available for the second trading system:

```mql5
input uint    B_BuyLossMMTriger=2;  //B number of loss-making Buy trades to decrease MM
input uint    B_SellLossMMTriger=2; //B number of loss-making Sell trades to decrease MM
input double  B_SmallMM=0.01;       //B Share of financial resources from the deposit used in a trade in case of losses
input double  B_MM=0.1;             //B Share of financial resources from the deposit used in a trade
```

The C\_ prefix is used in the inputs for the third system.

The most optimal option for setting up such an EA is configuring it on each trading system separately disabling other two applying the appropriate switches in the form of the following parameters:

```mql5
input bool    B_BuyPosOpen=true;    //B Permission to enter long positions
input bool    B_SellPosOpen=true;   //B Permission to enter short positions
```

by setting them to false.

For the generated EA to operate correctly, the compiled **ColorJFatl\_Digit.ex5** indicator file should be in the **<terminal\_data\_directory>\MQL5\Indicators** folder.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters with stops have been used during tests shown below.
