[Identify potential entries](/en/code/30105 "Identify potential entries")

I want to share with you this story. When I started trading, I learnt the scalping strategy in a volatile market. I really loved scalping especially when I see the price is moving fast. However, scalping for a long period of time is exhausting to me especially in a volatile market; volatile market requires fast analysis, actions and reactions; that is why I always reach a point that I loss concentration, focus and I start making those really stupid mistakes.
That is why I created this indicator that helped me to automatically identify these potential entries (based on the formation of candlesticks) instead of doing all the work myself. I know there are plenty of Metatraders who also suffer from this and that is why I would like to share this indicator with you, hopefully it will be beneficial. Do not forget to send you comments as well as rate these scripts. Happy trading!
