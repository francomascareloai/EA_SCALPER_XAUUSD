It's a triangular arbitrage system (three pairs correlation system) to use 3 currencies to make 3 pairs to open hedge orders on those.

The expert starts opening six orders for each ring (3 plus and 3 minus) and waits to move prices in one direction to make a grid of orders.

The expert can use a maximum of 8 currencies to make 28 pairs and make 56 rings.

It is important the order of currencies is from the strongest to the weakest.

**Strongest... EUR/GBP/AUD/NZD/USD/CAD/CHF/JPY ...weakest.**

Canto inputs minimum of three currencies and a maximum eight.

**All information about parameters you can see on[blog.](/en/blogs/post/722870 "https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/post/722870")**

Hello.

Expert uses avarage level to close orders at profit or stop loss.

For take profit there are these parameters ' Type Of Close In Profit Orders ' and ' Target Close In Profit (Value $/Lot)'.

For stop loss are these parameters ' Type Of Close In Loss Orders' and ' Target Close In Loss (Value $/Lot)'.

I'm impressed with your [triangular arbitrage](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/3150 "Article: Triangular Arbitration ") setup which is slightly different from the others.

What I'm looking for in the triangular Arbitrage EA's is the advantage it gives in relation to risk.

Arbitrage should have an advantage over regular EA's.

I would like to ask your opinion about profitability over Risk of your EA

How risk free is it? And how profitable is it.

It doesn't have to be very profitable as long as it is risk free.

Also do you have any other arbitrage ideas or advice or even an EA that you know of that works really well from the MT5 Platform?

I would be happy to pay for a consultation for your expertise!
