The trading system is based on direction changes of the [wighted oscillator WeightOscillator](/en/code/17063 "The WeightOscillator indicator for MetaTrader 5"). Sell ​​when the oscillator changes direction from rising to falling, buy when direction changes to rising. The signal is formed when a bar is closing.

The WeightOscillator\_HTF indicator in the EA is intended only for a more convenient visualization of trends in the strategy tester, in other operation modes it is inactive.

Place WeightOscillator.ex5 and WeightOscillator\_HTF.ex5 compiled files to the *<terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators*.

After compilation, the Exp\_WeightOscillator.ex5 expert file contains the WeightOscillator.ex5 and WeightOscillator\_HTF.ex5 indicators as [resources](/en/docs/runtime/resources "Resources"), and therefore, they are not required to be present in the terminal folder for the compiled EA to work! For this purpose, the corresponding code has been added to the EA code in order to include these indicators in the expert's executable file.

The indicator executable files have been added as resources at the global scope:

```mql5
//---- Include the indicators in the EA code as resources
#resource "\\Indicators\\WeightOscillator.ex5"
#resource "\\Indicators\\WeightOscillator_HTF.ex5"
```

The string paths to the indicators used as resources in the block of the OnInit() function have been changed:

```mql5
//---- getting the WeightOscillator indicator handle
   InpInd_Handle=iCustom(Symbol(),InpInd_Timeframe,"::Indicators\\WeightOscillator",RSIWeight,RSIPeriod,RSIPrice,MFIWeight,MFIPeriod,MFIVolumeType,
                         WPRWeight,WPRPeriod,DeMarkerWeight,DeMarkerPeriod,bMA_Method,bLength,bPhase,HighLevel,LowLevel);
   if(InpInd_Handle==INVALID_HANDLE)
     {
      Print(" Failed to get handle of the WeightOscillator indicator");
      return(INIT_FAILED);
     }

//---- getting handle of the WeightOscillator_HTF indicator for visualization in the strategy tester   
   if(MQLInfoInteger(MQL_VISUAL_MODE))
     {
      //---- getting handle of the WeightOscillator_HTF indicator
      int Ind_Handle=iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"::Indicators\\WeightOscillator_HTF",InpInd_Timeframe,
                             RSIWeight,RSIPeriod,RSIPrice,MFIWeight,MFIPeriod,MFIVolumeType,
                             WPRWeight,WPRPeriod,DeMarkerWeight,DeMarkerPeriod,bMA_Method,bLength,bPhase,HighLevel,LowLevel);
      if(Ind_Handle==INVALID_HANDLE)
        {
         Print(" Failed to get handle of the WeightOscillator_HTF indicator");
         return(INIT_FAILED);
        }
     }
```

Thus, the compiled executable file of the expert can be used on other trade terminals on its own without the indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578 "The TradeAlgorithms library for MetaTrader 5").

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

This is a standard StdDev indicator with an additional feature, which changes the line color depending on its values. When the value increases, the line color is painted in green; when it falls, the line becomes red; if values stay the same over several periods, the line color stays yellow.
