Since it seems that we can not rely only on the brute force of metatrader 5, from time to time we need to revisit the code and optimize it - for speed mainly. One example of that is vortex indicator (originally published here : [Vortex](/en/code/20462) along with detailed description.

This version is, regardless that the code is not simpler, significantly faster. Hence, it is more suitable to be used from any iCustom() calls

Found-out about Vortex Trend Indicator just today while I was looking for something similar and a bit faster than my DMI. It seems that your Vortex comes very handy! Thanks a lot for your post! =D
