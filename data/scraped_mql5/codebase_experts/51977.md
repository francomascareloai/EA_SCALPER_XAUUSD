Fair Value Gap (FVG) in trading refers to a price inefficiency or imbalance that occurs when there is a significant gap between the opening, high, low, and closing prices of three consecutive candles. It typically happens when one candle's range fails to fully overlap with the previous and subsequent candles, leaving a "gap" in the price action.

Traders view this gap as a potential area where the price might return to fill the imbalance before continuing in its original direction. This concept is used in various trading strategies to identify potential entry or exit points based on market inefficiencies.

Very good code, but I have a suggestion for those who want to [put it](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1171 "Why Virtual Hosting on the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms is better than the usual VPSs") in an EA calling the levels through buffers that don't exist, can you update it by putting the last range of Bull and Bear respectively?

If you don't want to rewrite the indicator with all of the code that goes with buffers, consider using GlobalVariables:

[Global Variables of the Terminal - MQL5 Reference - Reference on algorithmic/automated trading language for MetaTrader 5](/en/docs/globals)

They go quite easily with Objects.

Specifically, see GlobalVariableSet() and GlobalVariableGet() therein.
