If a high has two preceding highs (rising) and two succeeding highs (falling), it is considered a swing high

If a low has two preceding lows (falling) and two succeeding lows (rising), it is considered a swing low

[Backtesting](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks ") shows signals from the past but no "future" signals at all. Works on a live chart.

The signals do not appear in the [visual tester](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2661 "Article: How to quickly develop and debug a trading strategy in MetaTrader 5 ") and in real time you have to keep refreshing the chart to update it with the current signals. It would be interesting if it were possible to update the code or even add an auto-refresh to it to always keep it updated with each bar closing, for example, and not run the risk of missing a signal due to not updating the chart.
