Trading system based on the signals of the [ThreeCandles](/en/code/17676 "ThreeCandles - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator. A signal is generated at the close of a bar if a colored indicator candlestick appears.

The Expert Advisor uses the compiled indicator file ThreeCandles.ex5 for operation. Save it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578 "TradeAlgorithms - Library for MetaTrader 5").

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
