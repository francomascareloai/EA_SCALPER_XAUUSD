A script for creating straddle Buy/Sell stop orders.

The idea would be that they expire after a certain time period and would straddle the current price action a certain number of points.

If there is an existing open position, the position's stop loss would be set to 1 point less than the opposite order. If the script fail to set the position stop loss, the script would then just close the position and create the straddle orders.

Is this script available for MT4 or could it be modified for MT4?
