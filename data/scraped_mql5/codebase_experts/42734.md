That is such a bad idea as it could be disastrous if the objects are deleted accidentally!

You should at least incorporate some sort of confirmation.

that is why its named "ClearScreen" If its disastrous then no need to use. Its use is to clear screen as the title of indicator says

I don't agree, you can simply load the indicator - push the character - unload the indicator again. Obviously it should happen at the end of the day when you're finished with all objects. It's convenient.

Advanced Line Chart based on Japanese candlesticks.

[Highest High fetch](/en/code/42653)

The code defines a function "RangeHighs" that calculates the highest price of a financial instrument within a specified time range (start and end time). The time range is defined by 4 input parameters (hour and minute of start and end time). The highest price is found using the "CopyHigh" function and stored in an array, from which the maximum value is returned.

![Check the time periods used](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Check the time periods used](/en/code/42845)

The function takes two arrays of integers as parameters: "allowedPeriods" and "periodsToCheck". "allowedPeriods" is an array containing all the time periods allowed by the system, while "periodsToCheck" is an array containing the time periods used by the user in the indicator.
The function iterates through the elements of the "periodsToCheck" array and checks if each of them is present in the "allowedPeriods" array. If it finds any time period that is not allowed, the function returns "false". If all time periods are allowed, the function returns "true".
In short, this function is used to make sure that the time periods used in an indicator are valid and allowed by the system.
