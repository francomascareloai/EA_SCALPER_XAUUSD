**INTRODUCTION :**  
  
 For day traders. 2 highly important indicators to turn strategies into extreme winning ones. The Win/Loss ratio and the Reward/Risk ratio will allow us to identify the best times and days our strategy works the best

For example, if we run a bar in town, we don’t actually open it in the morning or in the afternoon because no one will come to have a drink. We will open it between 10 PM and 3 AM because during this period lot of customers will come for a drink. We might also want to consider that it is best to open the bar on Fridays and on Saturdays because people don’t have work the next day.

So, when we want to run a strategy (i.e. when we want to run a bar) we must examine it to know what is the best time and days to trade this strategy? (i.e. what is the best period that customers will come to have a drink).

[Mediator - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31659)

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently

For day traders, this is one of the important thing to consider in order to improve our strategy by calculating on average how much an asset moves, in which it will allow us to identify the best TIME during the day to trade when the market moves the most as well
