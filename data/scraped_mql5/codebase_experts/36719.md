Thanks for your useful indicator. Is it possible to create alert (email & pop message) for the Upper and Lower boundaries?

Fantastic job translating from pine script!

I was wondering if you could also translate "Price-Curve Channel" indicator from pine script to mt4/mt5?

Thanks a lot for the great indicator!
