The breakthrough trading system based on the signals of the [i-CAiChannel\_System\_Digit](/en/code/16014) indicator. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there has been the occurrence of a colored bar, and the previous bar had the opposite color or no color at all.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file i-CAiChannel\_System\_Digit.ex5 in order to run. Place it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
