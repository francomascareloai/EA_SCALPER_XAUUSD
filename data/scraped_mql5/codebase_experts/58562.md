It's a classic indicator which plots a moving average on volume (tick volume) instead of price. The histogram bars that describe the volume are coloured based on the price bars.

It's an MQL4 conversion and the original old code can be found here: [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/25462](/en/code/25462)

**Tick volume breaking above the moving average** could indicate increased participation - signalling strong trends or volatile movements.

**Tick volume staying below the moving average** might suggest lower liquidity, meaning the market is quieter or consolidating.

It was brought forward to me that the indicator no longer compiled.

I have now uploaded a new version which compiles without any problems for the latest version of MT5.

Takes trades based on ICT silverbullet and 2022 model with trailing stops and partials, also keeps entry according to OTE, and risk minimal.
It works in a small time window of silver bullet especially NY session, and if no trade found, 2022 model and fibonacci OTE jumps in to get a trade. But entry is so only after confirmation with these models being there, hence trades will be less for minimal drawdown and high winrate. To know more about these strategies, you may visit Inner Circle Trader YouTube channel.
