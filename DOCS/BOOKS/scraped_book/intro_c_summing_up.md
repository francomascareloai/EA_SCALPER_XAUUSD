# Mini summary

In Part 1, we got familiar with the MetaEditor framework, created a script template using MQL Master, and gradually filled the script with code to solve a simple problem. For this purpose, we used some basic principles and syntactic structures of MQL5. Then we tried the debugger in practice, fixed some issues, and came to a stable program operation.

Our script samples evolved as follows:

In the subsequent sections of this book, we will start to explore in detail these and many other features of MQL5, the technical aspects of programming, and its applications for trading.
