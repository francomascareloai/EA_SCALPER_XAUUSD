# Arrays

An array is a tool for cluster-based storing and processing the data of random types. They are supported practically in any programming language. They are especially important in MQL5 because they represent a convenient method of arranging serial data relevant to trading tasks. Quotes, readings of indicators, account trading history with orders and transactions, and news are all examples of serial data, that is, the sequences of time-varying values.

The array can be considered a container variable: It can contain a predefined quantity of values of the same type, which are identified by both their name and index (position number).

In this section, we are going to consider the common syntax of describing arrays and calling them, exemplified by [embedded data types](/en/book/basis/builtin_types). In the subsequent parts of this book, with acquiring information on how to extend the system of types due to the object-oriented technology, we will use arrays in conjugation with them to get new opportunities.
