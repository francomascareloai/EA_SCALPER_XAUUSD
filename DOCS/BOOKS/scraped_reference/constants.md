# Constants, Enumerations and Structures

To simplify the program writing and to make program texts more convenient for perception, the MQL5 language provides predefined standard constants and enumerations. Besides that, service [structures](/en/docs/basis/types/classes) are used for storing information.

Standard constants are similar to macros and are of [int](/en/docs/basis/types/integer/integertypes) type.

The constants are grouped by their purposes:

* [Chart constants](/en/docs/constants/chartconstants) are used when working with price charts: opening, navigation, setting parameters;
* [Objects constants](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants) are intended for processing graphical objects that can be created and displayed in charts;
* [Indicators constants](/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants) are used for working with standard and custom indicators;

* [Environment state](/en/docs/constants/environment_state) constants describe properties of a MQL5-program, show information about a client terminal, financial instrument and current account;

* [Trade constants](/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants) allow to specify a variety of information in the course of trading;
* [Named constants](/en/docs/constants/namedconstants) are constants of the MQL5 language;
* [Data structures](/en/docs/constants/structures) describe data storage formats used;
* [Codes of errors and warnings](/en/docs/constants/errorswarnings) describe compiler messages and trading server answers to trade requests;
* [In/out constants](/en/docs/constants/io_constants) are designed for working with [file functions](/en/docs/files) and displaying messages on the screen by the [MessageBox()](/en/docs/common/messagebox) function.
