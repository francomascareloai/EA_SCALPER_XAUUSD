**The author of the idea**: [John Smith](/en/users/scriptor "John Smith (Scriptor)"), **the mq5 code author**: [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn).

The following indicators are used:

* [EMAAngle](/en/code/1549 "EMAAngle - indicator for MetaTrader 5")
* [Laguerre RSI with Laguerre filter](/en/code/17990 "Laguerre RSI with Laguerre filter - indicator for MetaTrader 5")

The Expert Advisor first checks the possibility to open BUY or SELL according to the EMAAngle indicator: the indicator value and the configured AngleThreshold parameter of the indicator are compared. If the indicator is below AngleThreshold, a Buy position can be opened. If it is above AngleThreshold, a Sell position can be opened.

After that the EA checks other indicators, including 'Laguerre RSI with Laguerre filter', two Moving Averages and one CCI.

Condition for opening a BUY position:

![Starter_v6mod Open Buy](https://c.mql5.com/18/63/Starter_v6mod_Open_Buy.png "Starter_v6mod Open Buy")

The Expert Advisor had not been optimized, and testing on EURUSD, H1 was performed with the default values of indicators:
