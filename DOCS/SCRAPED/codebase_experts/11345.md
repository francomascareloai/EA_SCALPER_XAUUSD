The Exp\_MaByMa EA is based on the signals of the [MaByMa](/en/code/11342) trend indicator.

The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is change in cloud color of the indicator.

For a correct operation of the EA, place the compiled indicator file MaByMa.ex5 to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **while opening the position**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

excellent work

impressive

Thank you!

It finds entry points perfectly, but with the exit we need to look for different variants

If we could add trawl + breakeven exit, I think the [test results](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/TesterStatistics "MQL5 Documentation: TesterStatistics function") would be better IMHO.
