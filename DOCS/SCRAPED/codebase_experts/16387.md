This EA converts a chart to Renko Chart using the tick values. In fact, it does not perform any auto-trading, it just perform a conversion. Unlike the conventional approach, this EA generates the renko blocks from ***every tick***, which could be the most precise method (IMO). In the conventional approach, only the high/low values are used for conversion. But the actual market condition has a significant amount of change in the total pips traveled. It doesn't update on a live chart. I'm trying to make it on my next revision. I've also developed a renko indicator (time-dependent), which can be used on a regular chart along with other indicators. Should any of you require it, please let me know so that I'll upload it.

**How to use:** Like any other EA, open it in the strategy tester, choose the 'symbolname' and a small timeframe (M1 or M5). If you would need to convert within a time-period (eg: 2010-01-01 ~ 2016-01-31), choose those dates and "start". An ".**hst**" file will be generated in your MetaTrader 4 folder under "\Tester\Files" subdirectory. Copy this file to your MetaTrader 4 history folder. You may open this file from the menu: "File -> Open offline". The name of the generated file will normally be of the format "symbolname2.hst" (for example, "*USDJPY2.hst*"). Please remember that, since it currently generates blocks only through the strategy tester, it uses the simulated ticks that are supplied by the MetaTrader 4 historical data. The values will become "real" only when we use it on MetaTrader 5 or the live data, which is not yet ready.

**Binoy Raphael:**  

Hi Max,

Thanks for your interest. I'm working on it. I just have to find some free time to "beautify" the code before uploading. I may be able to do in a week or two.

Hi Binoy,

Well that would be wonderful. Look forward to seeing it

I think it is possible as indicator on normal chart? or maybe will have to be a subwindow? As a subwindow on a normal chart it could be advantageous anyway.

bets regards,

Hey Binoy

I love using the renko chart, what software do you use to write the renko codes though

![TimeInRange time checking function](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/library.png)
[TimeInRange time checking function](/en/code/16398)

Fast time range checking function. Doesn't use slow string parsing.

![Modify All TP SL](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Modify All TP SL](/en/code/16451)

The script modifies all orders (market and pending) on the symbol with specified Take Profit and Stop Loss.

![Stop & Limit Bots](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Stop & Limit Bots](/en/code/16305)

Two EA's. One places Stop orders the other places Limit orders.

![Var Mov Avg 2016 (varmov)](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Var Mov Avg 2016 (varmov)](/en/code/16492)

This indicator is based on the moving average, but it doesn't use any standard moving average indicators.
