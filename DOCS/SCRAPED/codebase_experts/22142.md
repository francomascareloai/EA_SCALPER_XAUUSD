Defining the channel width (**Channel Open Close**) for a previous day. If the channel width is sufficient, then the amount of roll-back is determined (**Rollback** AND **Channel Rollback**). Drawing [OBJ\_RECTANGLE](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_rectangle) objects.

The EA works on PERIOD\_H1 timeframe - this parameter is registered within the code and is not included into the inputs. Disabled work on Monday abd Friday. If there are no positions, and the last known time of the trading server is from 00:00 to 00:03 - then you can check the channel and the roll-back.

The channel width is calculated as a difference between Open of bar #24 and Close of bar #1.

If the position opening condition is met, the channel is displayed as the [OBJ\_RECTANGLE](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_rectangle) object:

Vladimir, hello, during testing I could not achieve any significant result.

Is this EA and [code published](https://forge.mql5.io/help/en/guide "MQL5 Algo Forge: Cloud Workspace for Algorithmic Trading Development") "just for fun" or is there some meaningful load.

Thank you.
