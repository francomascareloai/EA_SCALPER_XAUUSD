This simple, quick & dirty script code will output a CSV file of all the Signals' properties as reported by the [MQL5 Trade Signals](/en/docs/signals/signalbasegetinteger) functionality. With the resulting CSV file opened as a spreadsheet (e.g. Excel), you can sort them by your preferred metrics and choose that suite your requirements for copy trading. 

Please note that the [MQL5 Trade Signals](/en/docs/signals/signalbasegetinteger) functionality, only lists MT5 signals. See also [Listing all MT4 Signals' properties to a CSV file](/en/code/39087) for *MetaTrader 4*. It also seems to be limited to a maximum of 1000 signals (I don't know how many there are in total).

Before running the *script*, open up the "Signals" tab, and make sure that terminal downloads data for signals. Otherwise the *script* will have no data to report on.

The CSV file will be output to terminal's "**MQL5\Files**" folder. In *MetaTrader* go to the menu *File* → *Open Data Folder*, then navigate to the "**MQL5\Files**" folder.
