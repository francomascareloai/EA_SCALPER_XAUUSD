**INTRODUCTION :**

Most newbies and immature traders keep losing money because they don't know how important to calculate and see things in terms of percentage. Seeing in terms of percentage is a good trading habit that must be developed; despite the fact that small accounts differ from larger accounts, it will allow the trader to treat small accounts the way they treat bigger accounts.

**THE STORY BEHIND THIS TRADING TOOL:**

The story behind developing this trading tool was to build a good trading habit, which is to always think in terms of percentage rather than amount of money. This way will allow us to treat small accounts as we are treating bigger accounts, which will allow us to switch from small accounts to bigger accounts smoothly.   

**HOW TO USE IT :**

You can check the following video that will explain how to use this trading tool

**Rodi Chamii:**  

Your welcome mate.

If you have any suggestions let me know

the following part should be put in code for reach a clear chart when you unload the indi from chart :

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+

//| Indicator deinitialization function                              |

//+------------------------------------------------------------------+

void OnDeinit(const int reason)

  {

   ObjectsDeleteAll(0,"background");

   ObjectsDeleteAll(0,"RISKOVERALL");

   ObjectsDeleteAll(0,"Risking");

   ObjectsDeleteAll(0,"Target");

  }

Please edit your post and use the code button (Alt+S) when pasting code.

***EDIT your original post***, please do not just post the code correctly in a new post.

Hello there,

I see that you've been blocked by the community of MQL5. !

This indicator summarizes the volatility of multiple periods.

[Simple label indicator that shows Amplitude, Spread and Clock (time)](/en/code/34777)

This simple indicator is just a statistical label showing Last and Current Candle Amplitude (MinMax), Last and Current Day Amplitude, Current Tick Amplitude and Time Remaining for next Candle. It also shows Server Time (Market Watch) and Local PC Time so you can focus more on the graph and adapt to market hours.

[Solar Wind Indicator for MQ5](/en/code/34815)

This is a re-write of the old Solar Winds indicator for MQ5. There has recently been some 'excitement' about using this with other indicators for entry signals, and after a request to develop an indicator using it, I found that it was a classic re-painter - so I am contributing this code with an easy switch to allow seeing the indicator in re-paint versus non-repaint mode.
