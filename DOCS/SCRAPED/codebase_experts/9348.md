Hey guys I try this expert advisor  and it work well on backtest but in live
mode you will lose everything...The system continue to take signal even thought
you have exit, stop out or [take profits](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders") with the old signal. This mean the system
will take a winning trade and turn into losing trade many times over, losing trade
at the highest bar and losing trade in the lowest bar but in the backtest it won't
show. There is a bug there can't fix it. I try everything to change the setting
nothing work. In one night I lose over -$3,000 on a single signal, the reason it
continue to repurchase, I wish the programer who program this system find a way
to fix the repurchase position, this system would be the best. But unfortunate
not possible. The system has a hidden flaw, you would not want to find out with
live money.

You may want to check out the "Dodgy [Backtest](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article \"Testing trading strategies on real ticks\"")" Expert for some background
on the limitations of backtesting that are likely causing the difference in historical
and actual behaviour. A smooth equity curve in backtesting is usually a warning
sign that the performance of the expert is due to backtesting data limitations.
