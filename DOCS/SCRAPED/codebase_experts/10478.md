### Description:

An Expert Advisor designed to open and close respective orders at the first parabolic SAR signal.

Its performance depends on the custom parameters of stop loss, take profit, trailing stop, lot size for opening trades and more. This version works alongside manual trades and other expert advisors as per you requests.

### Note:

You need to change the SAR indicator "Step" and "maximum" value/s to that of the EA in order to match the EA operation with that of the SAR indicator.

But this is just for visual purposes as the EA does'nt need the indicator in order to work. e.g. if you are using the default step setting for the EA (0.001) you might get a false impression that the EA didnt open an order when the SAR indicator with its default step setting (0.02) showed a signal but in reality the virtual SAR with a step setting of 0.001 had'nt yet shown a signal.

If no order was opened and the journal displayed an error as to why, thats when action needs to be taken. Always check this page for updates thank you !!!.

Ive also included a full documentation for pSAR bug 6 available at our new site.

**tonny:**  
 however thats not a big deal for those who only trade a preffered pair

For you nothing is a big deal. It doesn't care to you at all....

Comments you get are not [important](https://www.mql5.com/en/economic-calendar/united-states/imports "US Economic Calendar: Imports") to you. From januari 2010 you have posted programs here.

comments you have get on those you haven't read seriously. You never do.....

If you wanna know what I mean read the comments of WHRoeder again (version 3 and 4)

And here your reaction on my comments to you. HOW will YOU EVER opening a trade with this EA on a ECN account ?

Preffered pair or not it doesn't matter. So why should we rely that donating and supporting your projects will be valuable....

The way it is now written is still garbage..... But that is not a big deal... Again HAVE FUN !!!!

I dont work for you and you dont pay me anything. I give part of my time to give free expert advisors to the world and you have no right to command me like i work for you. Instead of concentrating on your [projects](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7863 "Article: Projects allow you to create profitable trading robots! But it is not exactly") you are busy commenting mud on other people's downloads. All requests by downloaders are usually considered and if they are for the interest of the majority they are added otherwise why do you think i keep making new versions.

How long did you test it? Its not a must it opens orders daily but only when the set condition occurs.
