**EA Name:** TuyulGAP.mq5  
 **Version:** 1.00  
 **Author:** zvickyhac  
 **Platform:** MetaTrader 5

**Description:**  
 TuyulGAP is an Expert Advisor (EA) developed for MetaTrader 5, designed to automate a gap trading strategy that targets potential price gaps at the beginning of the trading week. The EA places *Buy Stop* and *Sell Stop* pending orders based on the highest high and lowest low from a user-defined number of past candles (bars) on Friday night before the market closes.

**Key Features:**

* **Automatic Pending Orders:** Places Buy Stop and Sell Stop orders above and below a dynamic price range derived from recent price action.
* **Scheduled Execution:** Active only on Friday at a specified time (default: 23:15 server time).
* **Order Management:** Automatically deletes pending orders on Monday and ensures only one order setup per week.
* **Day and Time Filter:** Ensures trading activity is restricted to specific day and hour settings.
* **Profit Locking:** Automatically closes positions that reach a specified profit target in USD.
* **Simple Configuration:** Input parameters include lot size, stop loss, magic number, max open trades, and secure profit target.

**Key Input Parameters:**

* LotSize : Size of each trade.
* StopLoss : Stop loss in points.
* LookbackBars : Number of candles analyzed for determining high/low levels.
* SecureProfitTarget : USD profit threshold to close open positions.

**Notes:**

* The EA is limited to one open trade at a time ( MaxOpenTrade = 1 ).
* No technical indicators are used.
* There is no built-in take profit or trailing stop, apart from secure profit closing logic.

**Use Case:**  
 This EA may be suitable for traders looking to automate weekend gap setups, with pending orders deployed before the market closes on Friday.

Thanks for sharing the code, I tested on [backtest](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks "), but there is no open trade, but its an interesting concept.

This MQL5 custom indicator detects divergences between price action and the Awesome Oscillator (AO), signalling potential market reversals or continuations. It plots buy/sell arrows on the chart, displays the AO as a histogram, and draws trendlines to highlight divergences.
