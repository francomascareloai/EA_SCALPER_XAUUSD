Nice one! Works great if you change the settings. The setting is wrong - change sell to buy and buy to sell. 😊

Strategy: price retracement in trend and breaks selected MA. When price breaks back through selected MA, buy/sell on recommencement of trend movement.

![Multi SellLimitOrders & Multi SellStopOrders](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Multi SellLimitOrders & Multi SellStopOrders](/en/code/44038)

Multi Selllimit and Sellstop orders are script files that enable traders to place multiple orders with ease. These orders allow traders to enter the market at a specific price level, or at a specified number of pips away from the current market price, with stop-loss and take-profit levels. By default, the pips value is set to 400, which means the trade will be placed 400 pips away from the current market price for a 5-digit broker.
Moreover, the multi Selllimit and Sellstop orders offer traders the flexibility to customize their trading strategies. Traders can set the stop-loss level to zero if they do not use stop-loss, and can choose between a target price or a pip-based entry. This level of flexibility allows traders to tailor their trading strategies to their specific needs, which can result in better trading outcomes.

[Simple check open orders filter boolean function for Expert Advisors](/en/code/44892)

This is a simple boolean function for the EA to detect if there is any previous open market orders without using the "OrdersTotal()" built-in function which might cause the EA to calculate positions not opened by each specific magicnumber provided by the EA.

[KA-Gold Bot](/en/code/45323)

KA-Gold Bot is an advanced trading advisor specifically designed for gold, utilizing the powerful combination of the Keltner channel strategy and two exponential moving averages (EMAs) - the 10-period EMA and the 200-period EMA.
Principle of Operation: The 10-period EMA represents the average price cutting above/below the Keltner band, confirming an uptrend/downtrend. The price being above the 200-period EMA supports the uptrend/downtrend. This indicates that the uptrend/downtrend has been stronger than the previous 10 periods, considering the volatility over the last 50 periods.
