Hi Hamid,

Thank you for this extensive EA code, it seems very well elaborated.

The C/R ratio of 8 to 35 that you claim is incredibly high.

Would you please provide us with more details?

* Obviously you've done back tests, could you show us results?
* Which are the most profitable FX pairs, and which are the worst?
* Which is the optimum time frame to apply the EA on?
