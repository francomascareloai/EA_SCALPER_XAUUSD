* Buy Stop: if the high of bar #2 on the D1 timeframe is higher than the high of bar #1 on the D1 timeframe and the high of bar #2 on the current timeframe is higher than the high of bar #1 on the current timeframe.
* Sell Stop: if the low of bar #2 on the D1 timeframe is lower than the low of bar #1 on the D1 timeframe, and the low of bar #2 on the current timeframe is lower than the low of bar #1 on the current timeframe.

* **Take Profit for SELL (in pips)** - the take profit level for pending sell orders.
* **Stop Loss for SELL (in pips)** - the stop loss level for pending sell orders.
* **Indenting price from High (in pips)** - distance from the high of the bar on the current timeframe.
* **Indenting price from Low (in pips)** - distance from the low of the bar on the current timeframe.
* **true -> If there is a position, do not place a pending order** - prohibits placing pending orders if there is an open position.

 Good afternoon! The test is conducted in the["Open prices only](/en/articles/239 "Article \"Testing Basics in MetaTrader 5\"")" mode, right?

Forget about such an inaccurate mode. At least it is necessary to test in the "All ticks" mode.
