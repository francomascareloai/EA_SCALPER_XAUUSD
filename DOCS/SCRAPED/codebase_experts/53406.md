The EA is based on several key trading and technical concepts:

1. Trade Copying/Mirror Trading Concept:

* The fundamental idea is to replicate trading activity from one account (Master) to another account (Slave)
* This is useful for:
  + Fund managers managing multiple client accounts
  + Traders wanting to run same strategy across different brokers
  + Risk distribution across different brokers

2. Account Architecture:

* Two-tier system:
  + Master Account: Original source of trades
  + Slave Account(s): Copies/mirrors the master's positions
* Uses a file-based communication system between master and slave instances

3. Technical Implementation Methods:

* Binary File Communication:
  + Master writes position data to a binary file
  + Slave reads this file to sync positions
  + Uses common folder access for inter-terminal communication
  + Faster and more efficient than text-based methods

4. Position Management:

* Real-time position tracking
* Maintains three key aspects:
  + Open positions replication
  + Stop loss/Take profit synchronization
  + Position closure synchronization

5. Symbol Mapping:

* Handles different symbol names across brokers
* For example:
  + XAUUSD.ecn on one broker might be GOLD on another
  + Allows flexible symbol mapping for different broker conventions

6. Risk Management Principles:

* Maintains exact position sizes
* Preserves stop loss and take profit levels
* Ensures synchronized risk management across accounts

7. Operational Features:

* Regular polling (every 50ms) to check for changes
* Bi-directional verification:
  + Checks for new positions to copy
  + Verifies existing positions are still valid
  + Closes positions that no longer exist on master

8. Error Handling and Recovery:

* Manages common trading issues:
  + Failed order execution
  + Communication failures
  + Symbol availability issues
  + Price differences between brokers

 Hello I attach the script to my accounts but nothing happened between the accounts, can you help describe how to use this script , thank you

It's an Expert Advisor (EA)--not a Script. If you installed it as a Script, that could be your issue.

MT5 automatically detects the type of an MQL-program. How do you distinguish between installation of a script and an expert? Both are provided as ex5-files. The folder where you place them is unimportant and only supposed to be standard in the navigator for your convenience.

I meant that if it's installed with the expectation of running once like a typical script, it's actually an EA that runs continuously. That's all.

Normally, you should provide some details for troubleshooting - your actions, settings, logs, charts/symbols, what you actually see, etc.

This indicator displays current events on the chart and allows you to export the calendar to archives for backtesting, automatically fixing time discrepancies between the history of bars and the history of events. This is an improved version of CalendarMonitorCached indicator from the algotrading book.
