This EA is based on 1 moving average indicator, the exit and entry points are determined by a "smoothing factor"; a fixed amount of pips above or below the MA.

It opens no more than 1 position at a time and has no stoploss, takeprofit or trailingstop, these may be subject to change in future versions.

This has been uploaded for experimental purposes, it is a very unpolished EA and I don't recommend running this on a live account.

**Testing Results:**

The following chart is a test conducted over a 5 year period, using the same parameters it has also worked decently over a 10 year period (2005 to 2015).

Standard settings are for the 1 hour chart on EURUSD, but can easily be optimized for any currency pair and timeframe.

Long term goal is to make this EA
profitable over a prolonged period of time, i.e 5 years or more with as
little complexity as possible.

Feedback is appreciated, enjoy.

Thanks.

It hasn't made any trades yet. I have it on M5 & H1 settings since last month maybe doesn't trade often?

Regards.

Strange, I have ran this EA live myself and it seemed to work ok then. What may have happened is the "point" rule is causing problems with 5 digit brokers, this may have caused an issue in your case. In addition, some brokers restrict lotsizes smaller than 0.1. Possibly some adjustments to the code will have to be made to make it work in your case. Your console likely reports some type of "ordersend()" error.
