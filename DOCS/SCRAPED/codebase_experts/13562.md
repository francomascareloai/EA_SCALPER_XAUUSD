The newly formed candlestick is analyzed, and an order is placed as soon as the breakout of High or Low of the previous candlestick occurs. Once the price gains profit equal to the value of stop loss, the order is moved to breakeven.

The number of orders is not limited, i.e. a situation occurs — an order is placed. In the screenshot is the result of testing on the daily time frame from the beginning of the year. The chart timeframe is specified in the program as well.

**pradeepgolfer:**  
 i want to change the time frame what does 240 mean?

timeframe = 240   minute = 4 hour

                = 1440 minute = 1 day

                = 60     minute = 1 hour

Could You modified EA in the way: 1) SL is not fixed, but goes as high or low the previous candlestick depends on direction of breakout.

2)  I can choose how many candlesticks are involved to break out - e.g. 1 - is only the previous one, 2 - high or low form the last two candlesticks should be break out, 3 - high or low form the last three candlesticks should be break out, and so on... similar with SL - you can choose how many candlesticks are involved to put SL

Hi, I can alter this schedule advisor at Renko, but this will require major changes in the program, so we can continue cooperation through the Freelance section. And one more difficulty, I do not speak English, so use the machine translator.
