This trend indicator shows the current trend direction and moments for closing of the opened position.

There are 3 variants of the indicator:

1. As a line (Variation.mq5);
2. As a line with color depending on current trend (ColorVariation.mq5);
3. As a line with additional JMA-smoothing for noise reduction (ColorJVariation.mq5).

The ColorJVariation.mq5 uses the СJJMA class of SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library, described in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).

The Variation.mq5,  ColorVariation.mq5 and ColorJVariation.mq5 must be placed to **terminal\_data\_folder**\MQL5\Indicators.

This indicator was first implemented in MQL4 and published in [Code Base](/ru/code/9802) 14.07.2010.

is it possible to just update Variation.mq4

similar indicator on mq5 [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/27](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/27 "https://www.mql5.com/en/code/27")

In MT4 there was and is such a function  
  
 iMAOnArray(ExtMapBuffer2,0,IdArray,0,MODE\_SMA,i)  
  
maybe this is the issue ? [https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/indicators/ima](/en/docs/indicators/ima "https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/indicators/ima")
