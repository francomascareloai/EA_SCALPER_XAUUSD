This EA takes calculates the current account balance and based on user's input of risk and profit percentage , it can close trades either in profit or in loss.

This tool might be helpful to people who prefer this method in managing their positions.

### **NOTE!!!**

In P\_pro, I included a line of code which opens one sell position at a time. This is just to demonstrate how the EA works and I have removed this feature in money management mq5.

If you notice any bugs or issues please let me know.

Hi, let me ask ..

Why do you divide PD and LD with 100 in both calculations in the function you made?

Is this related to the point size of the current symbol?

PD = 5

So PD% = 5% = 5/100

Same goes for LD%

If your prop firm allows EA trading then YES, it can.

Do you have documentation regarding how it works

![Tick Speed Indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Tick Speed Indicator](/en/code/43889)

This example was created to see how long it takes to reach 100 ticks.
So this indicator is a seconds / "centick" (centick = 100 ticks).
It helps you trade orders flow.
