**Key Features:**

* **Channel Length (n1):** Default 10, adjusts sensitivity of price movements.
* **Average Length (n2):** Default 21, smooths the WT1 line for clearer signals.
* **Cross Signals:** Generates notifications when WT1 crosses WT2, indicating potential buy (upward cross) or sell (downward cross) opportunities.

Ideal for traders seeking reliable trend-following and reversal signals across various timeframes and currency pairs.

You're looking for an MT5==>Expert Advisor.
