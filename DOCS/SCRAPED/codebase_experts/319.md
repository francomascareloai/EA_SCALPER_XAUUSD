The [MQL5 Wizard](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate") allows creating ready-made Expert Advisors based on the [Standard library](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses) classes delivered together with the client terminal (see [Creating Ready-Made Expert Advisors in MQL5 Wizard](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate") for the details). It allows to check your trade ideas quickly, all you need is to create your own trading signals class. The structure of this class and example can be found in the article [MQL5 Wizard: How to Create a Module of Trading Signals](/en/articles/226).

The generic idea is the following: the class of trading signals is derived from [CExpertSignal](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal), the next, it's necessary to override the [LongCondition()](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal/cexpertsignallongcondition) and [ShortCondition()](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal/cexpertsignalshortcondition) virtual methods with your own methods.

There is a book ["Strategies of best traders](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.tora-centre.ru/book/strategy.htm "http://www.tora-centre.ru/book/strategy.htm")" (in Russian), there are many trading strategies are considered there, we will focus on reversal candlestick patterns, confirmed by [Stochastic](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so"), [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci"), [MFI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/market_facilitation "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/market_facilitation") and [RSI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rsi") oscillators.

The best way is to create the separate class, derived from [CExpertSignal](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/expertbaseclasses/cexpertsignal) for checking of formation of candlestick patterns. For confirmation of trade signals, generated by candlestick patterns, it's sufficient to write the class, derived from CCandlePattern and add the necessary features (for example, confirmation by oscillators) there.

Here we will consider the signals, based on "Bullish/Bearish Meeting Lines" reversal candlestick patterns, confirmed by [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") (Commodity Channel Index) indicator. The module of trade signals is based on the [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class, it's simple example of its use for creation of trade signals with candlestick patterns.

  

**1. "Meeting Lines" reversal candlestick patterns**

**1.1. Bullish Meeting Lines<**

The pattern consist of two candlesticks (bearish and bullish) with equal (or very close) close prices. The body of two candlesticks must be greater than average body length.

The "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern indicates the reversal of a downward trend.

![Fig. 1. "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/meeting_lines_bullish_en.png "Fig. 1. \"Bullish Meeting Lines\" pattern")

Fig. 1. "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern

The recognition of "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern is implemented in CheckPatternCheckPatternBullishMeetingLines() method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class:

```mql5
//+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks formation of "Bullish Meeting Lines" candlestick pattern    |            
//+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool CCandlePattern::CheckPatternBullishMeetingLines()
  {
//--- Bullish Meeting Lines
   if((Open(2)-Close(2)>AvgBody(1))              && // long black
     ((Close(1)-Open(1))>AvgBody(1))             && // long white
      (MathAbs(Close(1)-Close(2))<0.1*AvgBody(1)))   // doji close
      return(true);
//---
   return(false);
  }
```

The CheckCandlestickPattern(CANDLE\_PATTERN\_BULLISH\_MEETING\_LINES) method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class is used to check formation of "Bullish Meeting Lines" candlestick pattern.

  

**1.1. Bearish Meeting Lines**

The pattern consist of two candlesticks (bullish and bearish) with equal (or very close) close prices. The body of two candlesticks must be greater than average body length.

The "Bearish Meeting Lines" pattern indicates the reversal of a downward trend.

![Fig. 2. "Bearish Meeting Lines" pattern](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/meeting_lines_bearish_en__2.png "Fig. 2. \"Bearish Meeting Lines\" pattern")

Fig. 2. "Bearish Meeting Lines" pattern

The recognition of "Bearish Meeting Lines" pattern is implemented in CheckPatternBearishMeetingLines() method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class:

```mql5
//+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Checks formation of "Bearish Meeting Lines" candlestick pattern    |
//+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
bool CCandlePattern::CheckPatternBearishMeetingLines()
  {
//--- Bearish Meeting Lines
   if((Close(2)-Open(2)>AvgBody(1))             && // long white
     ((Open(1)-Close(1))>AvgBody(1))            && // long black
      (MathAbs(Close(1)-Close(2))<0.1*AvgBody(1)))  // doji close
      return(true);
//---
   return(false);
  }
```

The CheckCandlestickPattern(CANDLE\_PATTERN\_BEARISH\_MEETING\_LINES) method of [CCandlePattern](/en/code/291) class is used to check formation of "Bearish Meeting Lines" candlestick pattern.

  

**2. Trade signals, confirmed by CCI indicator**

The trading signals to open long or short position must be confirmed by [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") indicator. The value of CCI must be greater/lower than critical levels (-50 for long position and 50 for short position).

The closing of opened position depends on the values of CCI. It can be done in 2 cases:

1. if CCI line has reached the opposite critical level (80 for long position and -80 for short position)
2. if the reverse signal isn't confirmed (when CCI reaches the following levels: -80 for long position and 80 for short position)

![Fig. 3. The "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern, confirmed by CCI indicator](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/Image_ML_CCI__1.png "Fig. 3. The \"Bullish Meeting Lines\" pattern, confirmed by CCI indicator")

Figure 3. The "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern, confirmed by CCI indicator

* int CML\_CCI::LongCondition() - checks conditions to open long position (returns 80) and close of the short position (returns 40);
* int CML\_CCI::ShortCondition() - checks conditions to open short position (returns 80) and close of the long position (returns 40).

  

**2.1. Open long position/Close short position**

1. The formation of "Bullish Meeting Lines" pattern must be confirmed by [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") indicator: CCI(1)<-50 (the value of the CCI of the last completed bar must be less than -50).
2. The short position must be closed if the [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") indicator has crossed upward the critical level -80 or crossed downward the critical level 80.

     result=40;
//--- return result
   return(result);
  }
```

  

**2.2. Open short position/Close long position**

1. The formation of "Bearish Meeting Lines" pattern must be confirmed by [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") indicator: CCI(1)>50 (the value of the CCI indicator of the last completed bar must be greater than 50).
2. The long position must be closed if [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci") indicator has crossed downward the -80 or 80 levels.

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+

**2.3. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard**

The CML\_CCI class isn't included in the Standard Library classes, to use it, it's necessary to download the acml\_cci.mqh file (see attachments) and save it to the client\_terminal\_data\folder\MQL5\Include\Expert\Signal\MySignals. The same should be done with the candlepatterns.mqh file. You can use it in MQL5 Wizard after restart of the MetaEditor.

To create an Expert Advisor launch [MQL5 Wizard](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/metaeditor/help/mql5_wizard/wizard_ea_generate"):

![Fig. 4. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_1__26.png "Fig. 4. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard")

Fig. 4. Creating Expert Advisor using MQL5 Wizard

Let's specify the name of the Expert Advisor:

![Fig. 5. General properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_2_ML_CCI.png "Fig. 5. General properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 5. General properties of the Expert Advisor

After that we need to select the modules of trade signals used.

![Fig. 6. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_3__26.png "Fig. 6. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 6. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor

In our case we use only one module of trade signals.

Adding the "**Signals based on Bullish/Bearish Meeting Lines confirmed by CCI**" module of trading signals:

![Fig. 7. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_3_2_ML_CCI.png "Fig. 7. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 7. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor

Module of trade signals added:

![Fig. 8. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_3_3_ML_CCI.png "Fig. 8. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 8. Signal properties of the Expert Advisor

You can select any trailing properties, but we will use "Trailing Stop not used":

![Fig. 9. Trailing properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_4__27.png "Fig. 9. Trailing properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 9. Trailing properties of the Expert Advisor

Concerning the money management properties, we will use "Trading with fixed trade volume":

![Fig. 10. Money management properties of the Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/MQL5_Wizard_step_5__27.png "Fig. 10. Money management properties of the Expert Advisor")

Fig. 10. Money management properties of the Expert Advisor

By pressing the "Finish" button, we will get the code of the generated Expert Advisor, located in Expert\_AML\_CCI.mq5, it will be saved in terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Experts\.

The default input parameters of the generated Expert Advisor:

```mql5
//--- inputs for main signal
input int            Signal_ThresholdOpen   =10;     // Signal threshold value to open [0...100]
input int            Signal_ThresholdClose  =10;     // Signal threshold value to close [0...100]
input double         Signal_PriceLevel      =0.0;    // Price level to execute a deal
input double         Signal_StopLevel       =50.0;   // Stop Loss level (in points)
input double         Signal_TakeLevel       =50.0;   // Take Profit level (in points)
```

must be replaced to:

```mql5
//--- inputs for main signal
input int            Signal_ThresholdOpen   =40;     // Signal threshold value to open [0...100]
input int            Signal_ThresholdClose  =20;     // Signal threshold value to close [0...100]
input double         Signal_PriceLevel      =0.0;    // Price level to execute a deal
input double         Signal_StopLevel       =0.0;    // Stop Loss level (in points)
input double         Signal_TakeLevel       =0.0;    // Take Profit level (in points)
```

The Signal\_ThresholdOpen/Signal\_ThresholdClose input parameters allow to specify threshold levels for open and close of positions.

In code of the LongCondition() and ShortCondition() methods of the trade signals class we have specified
the fixed values of the threshold:

* Open position: 80;
* Close position: 40.

The Expert Advisor, generated by MQL5 Wizard open and close position using the "votes" from the modules of trade signals. The vote of the main module (as container, it consist of all the modules added) is also used, but its LongCondition() and ShortCondition() methods always return 0.

The vote results of the main module is also used in "votes" averaging. In our case we have:  main module + 1 module of trade signals, so we need to take this fact into account when setting of the threshold values. Because of this fact the ThresholdOpen and ThresholdClose must be set as 40=(0+80)/2 and 20=(0+40)/2.

The values of Signal\_StopLevel and Signal\_TakeLevel input parameters is set to 0, it means that closing of the positions will be done only when closing conditions will be true.

  

**2.4. History backtesting results**

Let's consider backtesting of the Expert Advisor on historical data (EURUSD H1, testing period: 2000.01.01-2011.03.16, PeriodCCI=18, MA\_period=3).

In creation of Expert Advisor we used the fixed volume ([Trading Fixed Lot](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/samplemmclasses/cmoneyfixedlot), 0.1), Trailing Stop algorithm is not used ([Trailing not used](/en/docs/standardlibrary/expertclasses/sampletrailingclasses/ctrailingnone)).

![Fig. 11. Testing results of the Expert Advisor, based on Bullish/Bearish Meeting Lines + CCI](https://c.mql5.com/18/2/ML_CCI_Test_Results.png "Fig. 11. Testing results of the Expert Advisor, based on Bullish/Bearish Meeting Lines + CCI")

Fig. 11. Testing results of the Expert Advisor, based on Bullish/Bearish Meeting Lines + CCI

  

The best set of input parameters can be found using the [Strategy Tester](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/strategy-tester "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/strategy-tester") of MetaTrader 5 client terminal.

The code of the Expert Advisor, created by MQL5 Wizard is attached in expert\_aml\_cci.mq5.

This EA is surely a diamond in the rough!

I have looked at your code and see what you're doing, however it would make most sense to scrap the "voting garbage" and do the following:

**Open Long Conditions**

Set BuyLongAt as an input i.e. at +100.  Therefore, every time the CCI passes up through +100, you buy long to an input variable of MaxTrades.

**Close Long Conditions**

To unwind the buy long positions, wait until CCI passes down through 0 and close all positions.

**Open Short Conditions**

Set  SellLongAt as an input i.e. at -100.  Therefore, every time the CCI passes down through -100 you sell short up to MaxTrades.

**Close Short Conditions**

To unwind the sell short positions, wait until the CCI passes down through 0 and close all positions.
