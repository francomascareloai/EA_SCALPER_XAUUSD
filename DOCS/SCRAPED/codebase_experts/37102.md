This indicator is one of the series of "experiments"

* even though it is named CCI, it is not actually CCI
* the calculating method is changed significantly compared to original CCI which make the usage as it is usual for classical version (via fixed levels) obsolete
* for that reason a sort of dynamic levels are added (a sort of Donchian channel levels added)
* basic types of averages can be used :

+ for main calculation
+ for price smoothing (as a possible method of signals filtering without significant lag addition)

**Recommendations:**

* You can use the color changes as signals

**Comparison :**

* An example why is it still called CCI.
* Upper is this indicator, lower is the classical CCI.
* Regardless of the completely different values produced, the relative values / slopes are very similar
