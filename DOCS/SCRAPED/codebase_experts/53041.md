**Features:**

* **Automatic Fibonacci Levels**: The indicator dynamically draws Fibonacci retracement lines based on recent ZigZag highs and lows, giving a clear view of potential reversal points.
* **Dynamic and Static Fibonacci Options**: Users can choose between dynamic and static Fibonacci retracement levels. The dynamic levels update continuously based on the latest ZigZag points, while the static levels remain fixed to the prior significant high or low.
* **Customizable Appearance**: You can adjust the color, style, and width of Fibonacci lines for both dynamic and static levels, allowing for personalized visualization to suit different chart backgrounds and styles.
* **Optimized for MetaTrader 5**: The indicator takes full advantage of MT5's graphical object handling, offering a seamless and efficient charting experience.

**Parameters:**

* **ZigZag Settings** ( ExtDepth , ExtDeviation , ExtBackstep ): Adjust the sensitivity of the ZigZag pattern to capture more or fewer price swings.
* **Dynamic Fibonacci Settings**: Customize the color, line style, and width of the dynamic Fibonacci retracement lines.
* **Static Fibonacci Settings**: Customize the appearance of the static Fibonacci lines based on the second most recent ZigZag high/low.

**How to Use:** The AutoFibo indicator is ideal for trend-following and reversal trading strategies. By overlaying Fibonacci levels onto the ZigZag pattern, it allows traders to visually assess retracement levels and potential entry/exit points. This indicator can be used on various timeframes, making it versatile for both intraday and long-term trading.

Generally speaking - it's good. But there's an issue with the zigzag (the common zigzag) that it does not reveal the completion of the leg. That means it can simply repaint and repaint the Fibonacci levels as well

In general when we get the confirmed High-Low with Fibo then we plan the trade as per the direction...

the point I was making that you can easily lose, because when you think you reached the highest point, you see wow...suddenly the leg grows higher, and the high point is moot. So there is no "confirmed" high or low until it is too late. Sure take a gamble, I was just pointing out that the zigzag itself has this problem

![Hammer Indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Hammer Indicator](/en/code/53154)

The code above is a "Hammer" indicator that detects candlestick hammer formations (bullish and bearish) and inverted hammer formations (bullish and bearish) on a MetaTrader 5 chart. This indicator identifies price reversal patterns by calculating the size and ratio of the candlestick wicks based on adjustable parameters: MaxRatioShortWick, MinRatioLongWick, and MinCandleSize. When a pattern is detected, the indicator displays a colored arrow near the candle’s lowest or highest price according to the pattern’s direction. The code also includes functions to create and delete objects automatically when the indicator is initialized or stopped.
