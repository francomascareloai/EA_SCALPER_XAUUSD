Yeah, with Reverse, Max Trades Optimalization, and Close All Order at opening Reverse Position we can get Real Zig Zag EA.

add

break;

after the [trade order](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_trade_request_actions "MQL5 documentation: Trade Operation Types") is completed. this should stop it placing trades once executed

No, it just be complete EA if you rebuild add some [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions"),Int Init, Int Deinit, Int Start, Send, Modify, and Close Order
