The script has three independent functions for determining the current (nearest) FORTS futures.

The short name of the futures, such as **br**, is specified in the script parameters.

The script outputs the full name of the previous, current and the next futures.

Using these functions, it is easy to create an Expert Advisor that will select the current futures and trade it, both in the strategy tester and on a real account.

**Dmitriy Skub:**  
 Where does that kind of oil live? Is it a demo or something?

  

I don't know myself)))

The graph with the results of the script was attached by the moderators, for which I thank them very much!

I did not attach any results myself.

The point is not in the graph, but in the [comment on the graph](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chart_property#enum_chart_property_string "MQL5 Documentation: Chart Properties") (in the upper left corner, for those who are in the tank).
