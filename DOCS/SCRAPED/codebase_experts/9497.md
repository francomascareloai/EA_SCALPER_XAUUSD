Test and See. I proves to be a good EA with good profit potentials. You're free to discuss it and make it better for all members to use.

I've also tried to modify the Slope Directional Line EA by FxiGor. But the thing won't compile. Someone can try and make it better for everyone to use. You are also free to help make it better for me everyone. (note that I have not tested this one yet because of the error I encountered during compilation)

Thanks.

Hi Brayt,

I ran the "new fscea" EA in Strategy Tester and did not have good results. I then looked at the code and I think one of the signs in the Buy/Sell formula needs to be reversed. I got much better results when I reversed the sign. I believe for Buys - MacdCurrent needs to be above Zero (0) and Sells need to be below Zero(0):

Original Buy

if(MacdCurrent<0 && MacdCurrent>SignalCurrent && MacdPrevious<SignalPrevious && (......rest of code)

Reversed Sign -

if(MacdCurrent>0 && MacdCurrent>SignalCurrent && MacdPrevious<SignalPrevious && (......rest of code)

Original Sell

if(MacdCurrent>0 && MacdCurrent<SignalCurrent && MacdPrevious>SignalPrevious && (......rest of code)

Reversed Sign -

if(MacdCurrent<0 && MacdCurrent<SignalCurrent && MacdPrevious>SignalPrevious && (......rest of code)

Here is the results for the original Buy/Sell code and the results of the reversed Buy/Sell Code below it.[![](https://c.mql5.com/3/35/TesterGraph2_2_small.gif "Original Buy/Sell Code")](https://c.mql5.com/3/35/TesterGraph2_2.gif):

[![](https://c.mql5.com/3/35/TesterGraph_3_small__4.gif "Reversed Buy/Sell Code")](https://c.mql5.com/3/35/TesterGraph_3__4.gif)

The results look more promising, tho I did not test it extensively on different TF's or other pairs.

Hope this helps everyone,

Robert
