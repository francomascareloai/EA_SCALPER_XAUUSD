*Base market line:*   
It is recommended to trade when the line is in the range from the overbought to the oversold level. When the market base line approaches the range borders, expect a trend direction change.

*Volatility bands:*   
when the market is fast and active, the bands expand - trade in the direction of RSI and signal lines. During quiet periods, consolidations, waiting for news, etc., the bands are narrowed. If the bands are in a narrow range for a long time, expect a strong price spike and start of movement.
