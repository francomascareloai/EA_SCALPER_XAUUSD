**INTRODUCTION :**

The breakout strength meter is a trading tool that is used to identify which currencies are the strongest to breakout, and which currencies are the weakest to breakout.

Don't hesitate to send all your comments and I would appreciate rating this trading tool.

**HOW TO USE IT :**

* define and see how a breakout strength meter works.
* use this trading tool to confirm real and fake breakouts (the most important part)
* compile the script in MT4 or MT5.

You can also check the following video. It is about Currency Strength Meter

[Buy using amount instead of lots](/en/code/33184)

I find the lot calculation tedious so I just use this script and tell it the dollar amount to use. It then does the rest.
This works for any currency.
