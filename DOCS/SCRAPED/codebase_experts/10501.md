Hi Rocky, Nice improvement. How did you insert the MA50 indicator onto the RSI indicator window? How's your trade performance with this updated indicator?

![Trading scripts with pictures](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Trading scripts with pictures](/en/code/10500)

These scripts will record and file a picture of the chart at the time of each trade executed with them.

![True Range Envelopes](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[True Range Envelopes](/en/code/10497)

Envelopes with MaOnArray and Average True Range.

Very simple scalping EA, no Indicators. Logic is based on very fast price movements.
