**Some sources I have used:**

This article Displaying a News Calendar written by Slobodov Gleb and to read at [https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1502](/en/articles/1502) shows a way how to get data displayed on the chart. The file contains the description of writing a simple and convenient indicator displaying in a working area the main economic events from external Internet resources.

Another source I have used for this indicator is the indicator SimpleMarketInfo here to find [http://codebase.mql4.com/en/code/10000](/en/code/10000) made by born2trade (2010.11.25). It shows upcoming news events 1 hour before and 30 minutes after event. It also shows active sessions etc. It gives a look to all news events. Changes on this. I did wanna have the possibillity to choose the kind of news I like to see, and when local time isn't brokertime there was not the correct displaying vertical lines on the chart. And some other changes...

* timezones [/go?link=https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/](/go?link=https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ "/go?link=https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/")
* markethours: [/go?link=http://www.2011.worldmarkethours.com/Forex/index1024.htm](/go?link=http://www.2011.worldmarkethours.com/Forex/index1024.htm "/go?link=http://www.2011.worldmarkethours.com/Forex/index1024.htm")

**Update 14 October 2011**   **forex\_news\_market\_clock\_2.mq4**

Found a way to edit my post so by this I replace the old indicator with the improved newer version

Hope it is for all working perfectly. Like to know how you think about it. It's the best way for me improve my programming

Thanks bdeyes and heelflip43

Saw the error with changing the timezone of my pc

Made a change in how to get GMT value and used the suggestion of heelflip43

Also made a change for the spread

I only don't know how to put this new version at the top of this topic

So for all it is placed inside <https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.donnaforex.com/forum/index.php?topic=4339.0>

Hi Tjipke,

Yep, new version seem to solved all those issues. It's working great for me!

I think you have to re-post the indi again to get it on this site. Maybe whoever proofreads the post can help you link it back to this one (or you can put links between the posts).

thanks,

dave

Hi Tjipke,

It's great indicator for the news events, I've not seen such great indicator. Thanks again.

Recently i observed news events are not showing up on my metatrador. seems like http://www.dailyfx.com/files/  is not supporting any more. Any suggestions?.

Thanks,

Suresh

This is a great indicator but it's no longer working. Hope someone can fix it.

Hi ... Is it possible to show all past News lines, not only the future news lines?

Best Regards

[MA's on the side](/en/code/10463)

Often times I find my chart is too cluttered with indicators to see the price action, however I still need those reference points. My solution was to create an indicator which displays the current level of some of the MA's of the current candle.
