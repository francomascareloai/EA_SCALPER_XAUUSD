The expert place and manage pending orders. Runs perfectly on pairs with tight spread and low commission broker (commission plus spread equal or less than 1.0 pip).

Choose a broker with zero stop level and fast execution to use the expert.

The code is available for testing and studying.

**Cristian Ţari:**  

HI Nikolaos,

Do you know why the Time control function is not working on the [demo account](/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties")?

During the backtest, the time control works perfectly, but when you attach the EA on the chart and select true on the TIme control, it never opens any pending order?

Thank you,

Cristian

Hello,

there are not met the criteria to open orders.

Needs patience.

**Nikolaos Pantzos:**  

Hello,

there are not met the criteria to open orders.

Needs patience.

So, I've attached the EA on ETHUSD chart since today it's Sunday and the forex market is close. [Pending order](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_type "MQL5 documentation:") distance 150, Delay modifying orders 7, Step Modifying orders 70 and stop loss order 30 and I disabled the spread check for this application. The average spread is 70 pips or points on ETHUSD and its workig, it opens up two pending orders which are constantly changing.

Now, if I add the Time control for the next two minutes from 14:09:00 to 15:01:00 the EA deletes the pending orders and is not opening any pending order during these two minutes.

Therefore, the criteria are met for this setup.

Do you know why is not opening pending orders during the time chosen?

Thank you,

Cristian

Hello,

there are not met the criteria to open orders.

Needs patience.

I've attached for your attention a few screen shots from another test. I chose from 00:00:00 to 14:45:00 Time control - true. The market watch is synchronized with the time from my computer. The [pending orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_type "MQL5 documentation:") are opened during the time chosen but its not closing at 14:45:00. I still have pending orders opened and its 14:48:00 right now.

So, you have the proof now that the Time Control is not working.

Hi Nikolaos,

I want to let you know that eventually I have figured it out. It seems that the Time Control is set to GMT 0, so every time you activate the Time Control it takes the GMT +0 time.

However, during the [backtest](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks ") it runs according to your marketwatch time.

This Expert Advisor is a pure hedging system.

![Overlay Chart Modified to not repaint on each bar](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Overlay Chart Modified to not repaint on each bar](/en/code/26289)

Used to compare 2 currencies on one chart, the Original indicator will recenter its calculation on every bar, and hence the price will keep shifting up and down and so the historical relative values do not remain constant. This indicator was modified so that the 'center' or initial relative reference point stays fixed and does not update each bar. It will only reinitialize when the indicator is reloaded or settings are changed.
