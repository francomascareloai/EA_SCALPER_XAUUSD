This is not my code, but a conversion from an MT5 code [here](/en/code/95)

There were requests for this to be converted to MT4.

The formulae used are:

Resistance 3 = High + 2\*(Pivot - Low)  
Resistance
2 = Pivot + (R1 - S1)  
Resistance 1 = 2 \* Pivot - Low  
**Pivot
Point = ( High + Close + Low )/3**

Hello,

I don't see the lines exhibited on the example shown on my MT4's screen.

I send a file attached, providing a screenshot.

Thanks in advance.

José

Possibly because your chart range is less than 10 pips and the lines are drawn above and/or below.
