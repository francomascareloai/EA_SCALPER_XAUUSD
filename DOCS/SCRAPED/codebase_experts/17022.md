**Author of the idea** — [Boris](/en/users/pravednik "Boris (PraVedNiK)"), **author of the MQL5 code** — [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn).

Attention: parameters should be optimized on the M5 timeframe for the last 12 weeks!

The **PROphet** Expert Advisor consists of two independent linear perceptrons.

Each of them separates the input features — candlestick shifts — into 2 classes.

**Perceptron № 1 >**

* class № 1: BUY
* class № 2: flat or SELL

**Perceptron № 2 >**

* class № 1: SELL
* class № 2: flat or BUY

This is the main idea of the EA — not to combine the only BUY and only SELL classes in once perceptron.

Optimization is performed for the previous 12 weeks, on weekends, in 2 stages.

***Stage № 1:***

set variables to daBUY=true and daSELL=false. Optimize only the weights x1, x2, x3, x4 from 1 to 200 and the movable stop loss slb from 30 to 100, everything with a step of 1.

***Stage № 2:***

set variables to daBUY=false and daSELL=true. Optimize only the weights y1, y2, y3, y4 from 1 to 200 and the movable stop loss sls from 30 to 100, everything with a step of 1.

**After optimization both daBUY and daSELL variables are set to true .**  
The obtained results are valid for the next /future/ week.
