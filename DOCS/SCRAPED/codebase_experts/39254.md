### The idea of a utility EA

**Added** : symbol (' **Symbol** ') and magic number (' **Magic number** ')

A simple panel based on [OBJ\_LABEL](/ru/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object/obj_label) graphical objects. According to the specified symbol (' **Symbol** ') and magic number (' **Magic number** '), the panel displays the profit (in total and in percentage) on the trading account for the day, for the week and for the month. The origin is the calculated date of the day. For example, if it is Saturday, then the date of the day is Friday. Accordingly, in the calculation of profit, you must remain in the month of the settlement day.

Additionally, the amount of transactions for   day , week and   per month.

Почему-то неправильно считает прибыль за месяц.

Turn on the display of transactions in the history tab, something like this:

Don't hide history. Show your settings and all history. Read the help about the difference between a trade and a position.

Yes that's right. Counts all transactions(in/out). Ok.

Thanks. Expert great.

Thanks. Expert great.

I want to clarify: the EA counts ALL deals

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_IN | Entry in |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_OUT | Entry out |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_INOUT | reverse |
| DEAL\_ENTRY\_OUT\_BY | Close a position by an opposite one |

to take into account all commissions and fees (often commissions and fees are taken for both entry and exit).
