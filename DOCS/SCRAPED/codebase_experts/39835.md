### Description of the EA

At the time of the birth of a new bar, the Expert Advisor randomly generates a signal to open a position. Before that, the previous position is closed automatically.

Tested, it was fun

However, please add in the TP, SL and Trialing, to make it colourful and many variables to really uplift this piece of art.

Awaiting your updated EA, please make it another version.
