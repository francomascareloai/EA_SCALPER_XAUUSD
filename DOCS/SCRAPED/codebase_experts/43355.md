Useless script which didn't even work. Your ChartRedraw() will apply on the current chart only.

And it has nothing to do with a refresh as it's a redraw, not the same.

Its Working absolutly fine

Finally, this piece of code helped. It actually refreshes all the charts. It can also be turned to an EA which does refresh of the charts once in a while. Thanks!
