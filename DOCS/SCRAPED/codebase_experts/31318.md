**INTRODUCTION:**

Most traders keep losing money because they focus on money rather than planning their trades based on Percentage risk. For example, you might afford to risk $300 of your $3,000 account on one single trade (which is 10% of your account), BUT are you willing to take the same trade with the same 10% risk on a $30,000 account (which means you will risk $3,000)?

A word of advice: the path to become a [professional trader](/en/code/download/31304/239063/audcad.png) begin when you are able to see risk and profit as percentage and not money

![]()

**HOW TO USE IT :**

In the video below, we will guide help you see your risk and your target as percentage rather than money or pips. It will show you the same trades on two different account, a small account and a big account.

**RECOMMENDATION :**

It is very essential to build your [attractive market watch list](/en/code/31230) in order to be able to set your trades in advanced as it was already shown in the video above. In the video below, we will guide you step by step to create your own attractive market watch list for potential entries. We will explain

* How to install the script,
* How to eliminate the first set of unattractive charts from our market watch list,
* How to study each remain chart and make sure that they are attractive.

Remark: make sure you have downloaded all charts' data, or the script will be slow since it will try to download all charts' data while it is running

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW**

========================================

Please note that investing involves risks. Any decision to invest in either the real estate or stock markets is a personal decision that should be made after thorough research, including an assessment of your personal risk tolerance and your personal financial condition and goals. Results are based on market conditions and on each individual and the action they take and the time and effort they put in.
