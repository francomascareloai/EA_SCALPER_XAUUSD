### Description:

[FOREX Currency Powers](/en/code/19544) provides an example of calculation of Forex currency strengths using synthetic financial instruments.

Similarly, we can calculate the strengths of RTS, USD and RUB of the FORTS futures market.

Using the values of futures contracts "MIX-3.18" (~RTSRUB), "RTS-3.18" (~RTSUSD),  "Si-3.18" (~USDRUB), "Eu-3.18" (~EURRUB), we can create an indicator of currency strengths:

<FORTS.RTS> = (RTSUSD+RTSRUB)/2  
<FORTS.USD> = (USDRTS+USDRUB)/2  
<FORTS.RUB> = (RUBRTS+RUBUSD+RUBEUR)/3

Copy the CurrencyPowerIndex.mqh file to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Include.

After you launch FORTS\_Currency\_Power.mq5, the following synthetic instruments will appear in the Market Watch window: FORTS.RTS.M5, FORTS.USD.M5, FORTS.RUB.M5:

**prostotrader:**  

RTSUSD  points are not RTSRUB points

**fxsaber:**  

I think you seem to be conflating warm and soft.

There are no points. Dimensionless units (numbers from 0 to 1, corresponding to the [Close price](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/prices#enum_applied_price_enum "MQL5 documentation: Price Constants") position in the interval (Low,High)) are summarised and averaged.

All the more nonsense.

Why not add up the tail of an elephant with the tail of a stork?

Go "mine", in short. If you don't understand the author's chewed-up answer.

**Added for the author**

You write:

Using the values of futures contracts "MIX-3.18" (~RTSRUB), "RTS-3.18" (~RTSUSD), "Si-3.18" (~USDRUB), "Eu-3.18" (~EURRUB), it is possible to build an indicator of the strength of the "currencies":

<FORTS.RTS> = (RTSUSD+RTSRUB)/2

So, your [indicator shows](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/TesterHideIndicators "MQL5 Documentation: TesterHideIndicators function") the following

RTSUSD is (GROWTH) RTSRUB \* **NOT on Si**, but USD\_FIX, which is not linearly dependent on Si, so

Your indicator shows something incomprehensible, because you add USD\_FIX (RTS = MIX \* USD\_FIX) with rubles (MIX points) and divide all this mess in half.

That's why you get not the "strength" of RTS, but something incomprehensible!

In order to show the "strength" of RTS, it is necessary to calculate the SYNTHETIC RTS, and compare (perform any actions) with the real RTS

You have not even looked at the source code. You are our advanced.

MetaTrader 5 allows creating synthetic instruments. The price of such instruments can depend on the current values of a number of financial instruments. In trading, such symbols allow spotting the beginning and end of global market movements at an early stage. In this example we create synthetic instruments to analyze the strength of Forex currencies EUR, USD, GBP, JPY and CHF.
