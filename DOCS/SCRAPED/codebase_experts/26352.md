Hey I know it has been long ago somehow :) I hope the tool is still working and i wanted to ask if there is a way to open news [pending orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_type "MQL5 documentation:") on Gold and Indices with it? Or if there is another known solution for this eventually? :)

Greetings and thanks so much for your brilliant work!
