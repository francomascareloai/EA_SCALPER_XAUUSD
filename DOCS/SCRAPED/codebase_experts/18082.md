When a position is closed (exit from the market, reversal or a close by operation), a sound is played.

A sound alert is selected from the standard terminal package:

![Sound Alert Entry Out](https://c.mql5.com/18/58/Sound_Alert_Entry_Out.png "Sound Alert Entry Out")

### version "1.002":

Added new parameter *notification* t send push-notifications to mobile terminals based on the MetaQuotes IDs specified in the options window, in its "[Notifications](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/startworking/settings#notifications "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/startworking/settings#notifications")" tab.

This option is disabled by default (false).

The format of notifications is approximately the following:

```mql5
deal #127811212 sell 0.01 EURUSD, profit: 0.08 USD

```

The current specification sounds only on the close, but can it be improved so that it also sounds on new orders?
