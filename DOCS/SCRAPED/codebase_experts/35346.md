Colored Candlestick exemplifying a gradient. It was somewhat hard to find a good working example of DRAW\_COLOR\_CANDLES that was understandable, most of the comments were useless, and the documentation lacks to even specify the plot limitations (PLOT\_COLOR\_INDEXES being limited to 64 in length, [0; 63]) or which order the functions should be called.
