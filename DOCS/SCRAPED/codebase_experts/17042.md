The simplest EA based on the [fractal Force\_Index](/en/code/17008). Sells at downward crossing of indicator zero level, buys at the upward crossing of this level. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is crossing of the level.

The Fractal\_Force\_Index\_HTF indicator in the EA is intended only for a more convenient visualization of trends in the strategy tester, in other operation modes it is inactive.

Place Fractal\_Force\_Index.ex5 and Fractal\_Force\_Index\_HTF.ex5 compiled files to the *<terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators*.

After compilation, the Exp\_Fractal\_Force\_Index.ex5 expert file contains the Fractal\_Force\_Index.ex5 and Fractal\_Force\_Index\_HTF.ex5 indicators as [resources](/en/docs/runtime/resources), and therefore, they are not required to be present in the terminal folder for the compiled EA to work! For this purpose, the corresponding code has been added to the EA code in order to include these indicators in the expert's executable file.

The indicator executable files have been added as resources at the global scope

//---- Include the indicators in the EA code as resources  
#resource "\\Indicators\\Fractal\_Force\_Index.ex5"  
#resource "\\Indicators\\Fractal\_Force\_Index\_HTF.ex5"

Changed the string paths to the indicators used as resources in the block of the OnInit() function

//---- getting handle of the Fractal\_Force\_Index indicator  
   InpInd\_Handle=iCustom(Symbol(),InpInd\_Timeframe,"::Indicators\\Fractal\_Force\_Index",e\_period,normal\_speed,MA\_Method,IPC,VolumeType,0);

Thus, the compiled executable file of the expert can be used on other trade terminals on its own without the indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
