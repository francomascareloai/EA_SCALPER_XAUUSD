On ECN, ECN Zero and Pro MT4/MT5 accounts, **preset** stoploss/takeprofit price levels are not permitted.

 If a trader wishes to specify *stoploss/takeprofit values* for an order, the trader must modify the existing position after the order is opened.

 This EA helps traders save valuable time by ensuring that a new trade position is modified to specified *stoploss/takeprofit values* after it is opened.

This is especially helpful for **scalpers** who want to avoid the hassle of manually editing trade positions every-time a buy/sell market order is taken on a financial instrument.

You are 10 years late with such tool

Also, I see no [checks](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") for minimum distance nor errors

Great Tool. I use it to set hard stops for swing trades  though. Excellent work! Thanks.
