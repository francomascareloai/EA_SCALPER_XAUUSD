Thank you Evgeny, this EA actually works, IF! You must have a risk:reward ratio of 1:2. That is, a 100 pip TakeProfit and 50 pip StopLoss. It must also be across as many pairs as you can handle since it it random.

The only thing it lacks, in my opinion, is a Targeted Trailing Stop function. This means it does not trail until a certain profit is achieved, after which a Trailing Stop is invoked.

I am  not sure if a TTS will help, but it sounds good. Back testing is useless as the results are supposed to be random.

I am running it on a [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties") with about 21 pairs. Good results so far.

If it is truly random, then the results over a long period should have equal winners, and equal losers.

Time will tell.
