In general when you create an arrow on the chart, and then if you scroll the chart the location of the arrow will be changed.

sometimes it will be very high above the bar and sometimes it will be very much below the bars.

This is really confusing at time and not well visible.

In order to address this issue, the attached code will ensure that the arrows created on the chart will appear statically on the chart.
