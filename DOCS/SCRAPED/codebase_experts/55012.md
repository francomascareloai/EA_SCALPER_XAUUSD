**Description:**

The "Symbol Swap Panel" is a versatile utility designed for traders seeking to manage their chart symbols and Market Watch more efficiently. This tool allows you to easily swap the current symbol on your chart while automatically adding the selected symbol to Market Watch. The panel is tailored for traders who require quick access to multiple symbols and real-time market data without disrupting their workflow.

**Key Features:**

**1. Seamless Symbol Swapping:**

- Instantly switch the active symbol on your chart with a single click. This feature allows for quick adjustments to your trading strategy without needing to manually navigate through multiple settings.

**2. Automatic Market Watch Integration:**

- Every time you swap a symbol on the chart, the new symbol is automatically added to Market Watch, ensuring you have immediate access to real-time data and market information.

**3. Enhanced Trading Workflow:**

- By integrating symbol management with Market Watch, the panel streamlines your trading process, reducing the time and effort required to monitor and analyze multiple symbols.

**4. Historical Data Analysis:**

- The panel supports symbol swaps based on historical data, allowing traders to review and analyze past market conditions for more informed decision-making.

**5. Optimized for Accurate Data Loading:**

- The tool is designed to handle data synchronization efficiently. However, when changing timeframes, it is recommended to switch back and forth to ensure all relevant data is loaded accurately for consistent performance.

**Practical Use Case:**

For a trader who frequently monitors multiple symbols, the Symbol Swap Panel offers a quick and efficient way to switch between charts and update Market Watch without interrupting the flow of market analysis. Whether you’re analyzing different currency pairs or stocks, this tool ensures that all relevant data is accessible in real-time, enhancing your ability to respond to market changes promptly.

This utility is ideal for active traders and analysts who require a streamlined approach to managing symbols and Market Watch entries, offering a practical solution for maintaining focus and efficiency in fast-paced trading environments.

**\*\*\*NOTE\*\*\*:**

The current "Symbol Swap Panel" code excludes a default button image. Without adding a BMP image, the button will work but remain invisible.

To customize the button image in the **Symbol Swap Panel Utility**, follow these steps:

1. Place your own BMP image (24-bit format) in the **MQL5/Images** folder.
2. Modify the code to reference your custom image by changing the resource path to point to the new image file.
3. Ensure the image is correctly formatted and the path is accurate to avoid errors during compilation.

This allows users to personalize the panel by using their own button images.
