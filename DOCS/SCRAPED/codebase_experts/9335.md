### Description:

Maybe you are familiar with indicator [ytg\_DveMashki\_ind](https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/9211 "ytg_DveMashki_ind")  by [Satop](https://www.mql5.com/ru/users/satop).

It's convenient for visual observation of MACD on the price chart.

The signal lines has been added. The standard MACD has one line, here we can use two.

I think that addition will be very useful, especially to EWA fans.

note to users: it does not act the same as the default macd. even when I input the default mas and prices and [smoothing methods](/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/enum_ma_method "MQL5 documentation: Smoothing Methods") into its options, the lines do not cross whent he default one does, so just be aware.
