Big fan of your work, Thx for sharing.

Any reason why trades close at a loss when I enable Trailing Stop on all of your EA's?

Hello,

trailing stop place a [stop loss](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders") on negative pips and then start to move it if price move ahead from stop loss.

More times if stop loss is tight, can to close in losses...

![ZigZag Based on Close Prices](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[ZigZag Based on Close Prices](/en/code/26742)

The code is based on indicator ZigZag which is in-built in MT4.
I have changed it so that it isn't calculated on highest Highs and lowest Lows, but instead uses highest Close and lowest Close of chart price history.
See attached chart for differences: ZigZag (red) versus ZigZagClose (yellow).
