HI, you need to change signal bar number. [Check](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") bar number in the scheme, following the link in the description

Hi there Mr Barinov

since I have started trading, Parabolic have been my most favorite indicator,

when you developed this AI which time frame did you designed it for?

My preferred time frame is H1

[SeriesIntegerInfo and Rates Bar Information Utility, displays how many bars there are in all timeframes for any user selected symbol, and shows the 'CopyRates' information availablity for any bar](/en/code/26330)

This utility is not a trading information utility. It will only have value for those getting information on the Number of Bars that have terminal data. This utility uses the functions SeriesIntegerInfo and CopyRates to obtain and display information about the availability of bar information from the terminal.

Very popular but dangerous strategy which doubles the stakes after each loosing trade. Finally, if there is enough margin it will reverse into the direction of the current price move and will eventually close in profit.
