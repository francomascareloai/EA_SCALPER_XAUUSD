The Exp\_Karpenko EA is based on the signals generated by [Karpenko](/ru/code/11243) oscillator.

The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is change in cloud color of the indicator.

For a correct operation of the EA, place the compiled indicator file Karpenko.ex5 to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **while opening the position**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

This Expert Advisor is based on the signals of [Simple Moving](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "MetaTrader 5 Help: Moving Average indicator") Average (SMA) - it is obvious, and it is appropriate to call it EXP\_SMA. This Expert Advisor is related to my Karpenko indicator only insofar as it uses SMA as a base curve,

because the indicator uses SMA as a basic curvilinear axis of ordinates - and only that. There is nothing to comment on. Think about what to do with it.

Usually, everyone is interested in concrete trading results of an [Expert Advisor](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/mt5/ "A Market of Applications for the MetaTrader 5 and MetaTrader 4"), not in its speculative compliance with some tricky rules! If there is no benefit on a particular market, just look for another Expert Advisor, and if the result deserves attention, then I don't care about all your speculations!

I tell you once again, you have a seriously distorted idea of the value and significance of things of the real world!
