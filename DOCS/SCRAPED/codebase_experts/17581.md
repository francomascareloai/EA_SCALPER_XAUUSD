**Author of the idea** — [Dmitry](/en/users/saw1 "Dmitry (SAW1)"), **author of the MQL5 code** — [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn). 

The idea is based on the [T3MA-ALARM](/en/code/1149) indicator. The expert Advisor performs a Sell or a Buy operation when an arrow appears.

You can configure to perform one or multiple trades at a time.

Recommended for use on timeframes H1 and above.

 Im very interested in this EA as I love the T3MA indicator. BUT every time I try to load the EA it wont load and says in journal 'failed mwith code 1' ?

Indicator "T3MA-ALARM.mq5" must be placed in the Indicators folder.

Indicators and [Expert Advisors](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/mt5 "A Market of Applications for the MetaTrader 5 and MetaTrader 4") cannot be saved in the same folder. Examine the terminal log - there will be a description of your error.
