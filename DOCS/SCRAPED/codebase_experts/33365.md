**INTRODUCTION :**

The breakout strength meter is a trading tool that is used to identify which currencies are the strongest to breakout, and which currencies are the weakest to breakout.

Don't hesitate to send all your comments and I would appreciate rating this trading tool.

  

**HOW TO USE IT :**

* define and see how a breakout strength meter works.
* use this trading tool to confirm real and fake breakouts (the most important part)

hi.

This indicator works fine

As Rodi says:

First you must have 28 currency pairs and fast PC and connection

If you don't know how to use it don't commend

Fallow the steps in the video to set it up,but you must have a fast internet and good PC

Use daily chart

Thanks for the indicator

I will test it [on Monday](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/marketinfoconstants#enum_day_of_week "MQL5 documentation: Symbol properties") but it looks fine

I use 6 pc and my screens are always open

If you are a pro trader,you must sit front of the screens 24/7

I use my own indicators but this indicator looks interesting

Rodi spent time to make this indicator,respect people and the afford they put in for you to use it.
