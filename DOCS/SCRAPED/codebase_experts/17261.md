Reconstruction of positions — an example of working with a trading history on Hedge accounts.

An example of the final output:

position #0  
DEAL\_ENTRY\_IN, type DEAL\_TYPE\_BUY, price 1.04552, Deal EURUSD, volume 0.03, DEAL\_POSITION\_ID #119707903, profit 0.00  
DEAL\_ENTRY\_OUT\_BY, type DEAL\_TYPE\_SELL, price 1.04562, Deal EURUSD, volume 0.02, DEAL\_POSITION\_ID #119707903, profit 0.20  
DEAL\_ENTRY\_OUT\_BY, type DEAL\_TYPE\_SELL, price 1.04534, Deal EURUSD, volume 0.01, DEAL\_POSITION\_ID #119707903, profit -0.18

As can be seen, deals taken from the trading history are grouped into positions to which they relate. Grouping by parameter

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEAL\_POSITION\_ID | [The ID of the position](/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/positionproperties#enum_position_property_integer), which the deal opened, modified or closed. Each position has a unique ID that is assigned to all deals executed on the symbol during the position lifetime. | long |
