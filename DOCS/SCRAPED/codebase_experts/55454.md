**Gain/Loss Info MetaTrader indicator** — displays the gains and losses for all candles where the given threshold is surpassed. The values are calculated in points and percentage. The indicator can calculate gain/loss in two modes: plain candlestick Close and Open difference, and as difference between current Close and previous Close. You can set minimum change limits (for pips and percentage), change modes, and you can also control font color of the output numbers. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

## Input parameters

* **PercentageLimit** (default = 1.0) — minimum threshold for the change to be displayed; in percentage points.
* **PointsLimit** (default = 1000) — minimum threshold for the change to be displayed; in points.
* **CloseToClose** (default = true) — if *true*, the indicator will compare current Close to previous Close; if *false*, it will compare current Close to current Open.
* **DisplayLossColor** (default = clrRed) — color of the negative price change display.
* **DisplayGainColor** (default = clrGreen) — color of the positive price change display.
* **MaxBars** (default = 100) — maximum number of bars to calculate the indicator on. The higher is the number the more lagging indicator becomes.
* **FontFace** (default = "Verdana") — the font face to use for display.
* **FontSize** (default = 10) — the font size to use for display.
* **ObjectPrefix** (default = "GLI-") — prefix for chart objects for compatibility with other indicators.

The chart above shows the example usage of the Gain/Loss Info indicator on GBP/USD @ W1. The percentage limit was set to 1.0% and pips limit was set to 1,500 pips. The calculation mode was set to "Close vs. previous Close." Points count for period is displayed below candles. Percentage change — above candles.

Obviously, it is nearly impossible to use this indicator to generate trading signals. Its main purpose is to simplify the analysis of the market situation and to make it easier to find some bullish and bearish patterns. Of course, you can still use the data about abnormally big changes as some sort of entry or exit signals.

[Keltner Channel MT4](/en/code/55456)

Keltner Channel (MetaTrader indicator) — is a classical technical analysis indicator developed by Chester W. Keltner in 1960. The indicator is somewhat similar to the Bollinger Bands and Envelopes. It uses three plot lines: the middle line is the 10-day simple moving average applied to the typical price ((high + low + close) / 3), the upper and the lower bands are produced by adding and subtracting the moving average of the daily price range (High and Low difference) from the middle line. This way, a volatility-based channel is built. In this version of the indicator you can modify all the parameters of the MA. The indicator is available both for MT4 and MT5 versions of the platform.

[Price Alert MT4](/en/code/55464)

Price Alert MetaTrader indicator — can issue any type of alert when the price reaches certain levels set by a trader. There are three types of price levels: the first one is used when the price rises above certain level (displayed with the green line on the chart), the second one is used when the price falls below certain level (displayed with the red line on the chart), and the third one is used when the price reaches the certain level exactly (displayed with the yellow line). Three alert types include: native (popup), email, and push-notification. For email and push-notification alert features to work, you need to set up the email or MetaQuotes ID settings in your MetaTrader platform options window.
