**Heiken Ashi Smoothed** (based on asiapacfinance.com [article](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/blog/2012/02/21/mt4-indicator-review-heiken-ashi-smoothed/ "http://www.asiapacfinance.com/blog/2012/02/21/mt4-indicator-review-heiken-ashi-smoothed/"))

In this video, we conduct a simple review of how we would trade the Heiken Ashi Smoothed MT4 indicator  
  
In the Video above, the silver moving line is the price. The blue and red indicators are the Heiken Ashi bars. Blue indicates bullish momentum, while red indicates bearish momentum.  
  
This indicator will probably work well in combination with another indicator. It reduces “fake-outs” and fake reversals while keeping you in trends with momentum indicated by the color of the bars.  
  
Heikin Ashi is a type of trading chart that originated in Japan (heikin ashi translates as average bar). Heikin Ashi charts are similar to candlestick and bar charts in that they show similar information (the open, high, low, and close of the time frame), but Heikin Ashi charts calculate the information differently.  
  
Heikin Ashi charts are used in trading in the same manner as standard candlestick or bar charts (i.e. chart patterns are used to indicate price movements). However, Heikin Ashi charts have an additional aspect in that the direction of the bar (i.e. its color for candlesticks) is supposed to indicate the overall direction of the market, while ignoring the intermediate direction (e.g. false changes of direction).

Hello, Dmitry

congrats on this nice indi you got, thanks for sharing.

The reason i'm writing is because i use mt4 and this is for mt5. Do you have it in mq4? i'm specially interested in using regulars candles but with heiken ashi colour. If you could help me, and with your permission, i can try to convert it or modify, but i'm no expert in mt4 coding and converting mt5 [functions](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined macro replacements") might be over my head.

thanks,

Luis
