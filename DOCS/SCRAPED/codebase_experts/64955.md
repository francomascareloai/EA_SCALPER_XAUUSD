This indicator calculate count of one direction movement in selected period.

That a bit similar to renko charts, but also include both direction movement into account.

The indicator can help you easily recognize consolidation zones to use breakout strategy.

Alternatively known as the "breakout box."

Ironically, most breakout box indicators only consist of 2 [horizontal lines](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object "MQL5 documentation: Object Types").

In contrast, your Consolidation indicator is a real box.👍

You just relied on the Pic. In the code. I realized it draws a histogram & not a box

Yeah, something is awry. The histogram in the separate indicator window is named "Disbalance" while the download file is named "Consolidation."

I guess that Consolidation is actually Disbalance with no box drawn?... or maybe Consolidation was never actually uploaded?

I'm doubtful that the rectangle was coded in the indicator based on it not being there. But it could be, and it would be a more sophisticated upgrade of the original
