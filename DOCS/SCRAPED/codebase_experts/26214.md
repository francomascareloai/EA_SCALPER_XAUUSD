**Roberto Jacobs:**  

In the indicator where you made this comment, there is absolutely no [trend line](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object "MQL5 documentation: Object Types"), fibonacci or box.

Hi Roberto

I did not mean to say that a trendline or anything else is drawn by the indicator.   
Sorry, I may not have explained myself properly.

What I wanted to say is that with the indicator on a chart, the following happens:  
Imagine you are on the daily chart and you draw a trendline on the chart.  
If you want to check the price action then on the hourly chart, the trendline previously drawn on the daily chart is gone.

The same happens when you draw i.e. a fibonnaci or a box or triangle for patterns.  
Once you switch from one TF to another TF, the chart is completely cleared.  
See attached example images.

Thank you for your quick reply and I hope you understand my point.

Thank you in advance

Regards,

[Bars and Rates Information Utility, displays how many bars there are in all timeframes for any user selected symbol, and shows the 'CopyRates' information availablity for any bar](/en/code/26316)

This utility is not a trading or market information utility. This will likely only interest those writing (or debugging) indicators using multiple timeframes and collecting information using Bars (or iBars) and CopyRates.
The utility creates a list showing the number of Bars reported by the "Bars" function and shows the success of CopyRates for any selected bar by displaying that bar's time from the collected data (or, it shows the error).
