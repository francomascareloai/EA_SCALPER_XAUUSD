When run on the price chart, the script modifies stop loss or take profit of all open orders for the current instrument.

**Example:** If multiple buy positions are opened on the GBPUSD pair, dragging the script to the chart below the current price causes the stop loss levels of all open positions to be modified, and dragging it above the current price causes the take profit levels to be modified.

Script has an error. For the buy order it tries to place SL if dropped above and TP below. I have modified code locally, but Author should upload corrected version!

It would have been nice of you to put the correct code for all of us non-techy guys. Could you please? Thank you!

I can see that this only works for buy orders. How can I use it for [sell orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_book_type "MQL5 documentation: Trade Orders in Depth Of Market")? Also, it only places the TP and not the SL.
