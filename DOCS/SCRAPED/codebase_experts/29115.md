It's a two (2) pairs correlation system to use 3 currencies to make 2 pairs to open hedge orders on those (like EURUSD/EURGBP).

The expert starts opening four orders for each couple (2 plus and 2 minus) and wait to move prices in one direction to make a grid of orders.

Can use a maximum of 5 currencies to make 10 pairs and make 30 couples.

It is important the order of currencies is from the strongest to the weakest.

**Strongest... EUR/GBP/AUD/NZD/USD/CAD/CHF/JPY ...weakest.**

Canto inputs minimum of three currencies and a maximum of five.

Hello Nikolaos,

Looks like your robot is interesting. But how to add another pair? Because on my mt5, there are only 3 pairs of currencies. I want to add other [currency pairs](https://www.mql5.com/en/blogs/tags/forexnews "Latest news from foreign exchange market"), such as CAD / CHF / NZD and others.

I see the trades keeps opening in normal operation and it auto closed few of the profitable trades.

How do we end the EA without much lossing on the existing open positions?
