**asim.iqbal:**  

Sir the robot is closing all the order in all the pairs in same time. I have tested it. It is not closing the orders by Symbol. Please check.

Thank you.

Best regards.

Thanks Sir, this is the right code.

Change this line

if(OrderSelect(i,SELECT\_BY\_POS))

To

if(OrderSelect(i,SELECT\_BY\_POS) &&  OrderSymbol()==Symbol())

Can you make it so that you have a choice.  Close ONLY all buy orders. Or only all [sell orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/enum_book_type "MQL5 documentation: Trade Orders in Depth Of Market") for that symbol.

[Close All Positions Type](/ru/code/30356) : You can specify the position type and profit type. One limitation: the EA works for all symbols and for all Magic numbers.
