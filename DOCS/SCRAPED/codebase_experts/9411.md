**Author:**

Me

You have many informations about the MARKET and CURRENCY in ONE SUBWINDOW

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/21/Brother2_1_small.jpg)](https://c.mql5.com/18/21/Brother2_1.jpg)

Recommendations:

* Every currency pair and every BROKER
* You don't need change anything I think

  

**I have also added the template to take nice effect for this indicator - brother2.tpl (brother2.zip file - unzip it to {drive letter}:\Program files\{Meta trader folder}\templates)**

Great work! Congratulations!! I am just about to understand better how the "risk" advise (which seems to be set by default on 8%) is working...

You'd be a fool not to add this indicator to your charts

![SuperMultiChart](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[SuperMultiChart](/en/code/9406)

The universal multi-chart of the currencies, with the changed list of currencies, a range of display, the period and position in a window.

![Expertoscope](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Expertoscope](/en/code/9408)

It saves the current expert parameters for all the experts attached to charts.

[Осцилятор на упрощённом алгоритме перцептрона](/en/code/9420)

Две версии индикатора на упрощённом алгоритме перцептрона

[NettoTrading](/en/code/9275)

The script allows to use MetaTrader4 as netting platform. It has some advantages compared with MetaTrader5.
