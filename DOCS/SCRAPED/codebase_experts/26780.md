* Many architectures start with Factory method, then evolve to AF, Prototype, Builder
* Builder makes complex objects step-by-step. AF makes families of related products. Builder returns the object after all steps are
  complete. AF returns its object at once.
* AF classes are often made with Factory Method/Prototype
* AF can be used instead of Facade to hide classes
* AF and Bridge can be used together, if you have abstractions which will work only with some real classes.
* AF, Builder, Prototype can be made with Singleton

When the subject changes, it notifies and updates its observers, who know nothing about each other.

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
