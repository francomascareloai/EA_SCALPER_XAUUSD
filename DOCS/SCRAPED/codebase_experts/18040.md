The Exp\_Stochastic\_Chaikins\_Volatility Expert Advisor is based on the [Stochastic\_Chaikins\_Volatility](/en/code/18004 "Stochastic_Chaikins_Volatility - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator color change. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if there is change in cloud color of the indicator.

The Expert Advisor uses the compiled indicator file Stochastic\_Chaikins\_Volatility.ex5 for operation. Save it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578 "TradeAlgorithms - Library for MetaTrader 5").

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
