The Exp\_AFL\_WinnerSign Expert Advisor is based on signals generated by the [AFL\_WinnerSign](/en/code/12605) semaphore arrow signal indicator.

The signal is formed when the bar is closing if a star appears for the previous closed bar.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file AFL\_WinnerSign.ex5 in order to run. Place it in <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
