Dadali,

This template must be nice for a coder to use. I do not really understand using it to trade with (which you advised not to use this to trade live) unless there is an ATR calculation used for SL, TP, Trail and Step. By using this template you are causing a trader to set a static setting globally across many differing instruments which have various ranges.

I do not know much about coding but you seem to be very generous with your knowledge. I can imagine you could replace those static inputs with a "percent ATR calculation" which would solve the problem.

I am a trader not a coder and I am only trying to help. To me the final destination leads to trading.

Michael

Hi @moneyfoundbymichael,

You can test it just by attach the EA just for 1 chart (any Symbols).

The settings for MagicNumber is just for differentiation from other EAs, so it wont bother other EAs behaviours.

I will put a picture for clearer image.

You can select the 3 different symbol mode for testing. And add/remove the symbols (separated by comma).

For Prefix and Postfix, you can add it if your broker has it or leave it blank if doesn't.

I made this EA just for a template for multisymbol function. Please do not use it in live account.

Regards.

I've been testing for an hour and I've found this promising result on the M10 chart:

Now I'll be working on ATR stops, if someone makes a progress into this code I would be grateful about being notified. Thank you.

Greetings Dadali Arwaly,

Thank you for sharing your work. I have started a new 2K Demo to forward test your EA and waiting for the market to open. I installed it on 2 barcharts (can candlesticks be used?) EUR/USD & GBP/USD. From what I can understand this EA will work on the chart it is installed on...correct? I suppose the magic numbers should be unique...correct?

I am quoting a post of yours that brings a new question:

*I have fixed the multisymbol [functions](/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions"), now it has 3 different mode:*

* *Current Chart Symbol*
* *All Market Watch*
* *Defined Symbol Lists*

How do I choose these modes? Do I go into the code? Where? I apologize in advance for not knowing coding so well. Perhaps it is all automatic and I should just install it on my charts and it will all work.

I have attached my workspace and settings file.

How is the result???

this is quite interesting
i was wondering if we could add some additional confirmations tto this EA nothing fancy [rate of change](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/6947 "Article: Methods for measuring the speed of price movement ") would do just fine
