The Expert Advisor tracks positions of all symbols with all magic numbers. If a position has been open for "Waiting for seconds" and its profit has reached "Take Profit" points, the EA closes the position. If the profit has not reached "Take Profit" points, the EA moves the take profit level.

### Input Parameters

* **Waiting for seconds** - the number of seconds to hold a position after the opening time;
* **Take Profit** - the number of take profit points.

**fxsaber:**  

I have never been able to understand why many people use such constructions (I have come across them more than once) - they look at point/digits to do something extra with them.

There must be a point, but I couldn't realise why they write like that. After all, it came from someone.

  

The logic there is simple -- 1) to make the same settings suitable for different digits and 2) many people are just more used to 4 digits.

It's just that some people use it correctly and unobtrusively, while others use it ugly.

**Vladimir Karputov:**

  

karputov -- I didn't harass you and you don't need to start.

p.s. it is always better to speak constructively -- especially since the "bug" in this code of yours is obvious (in many other codes of yours too).

If it were not for your attacks "MT4 adherents without support", like "everyone here is lazy" -- I would have passed by at all.

carputov -- I wasn't being rude to you and you don't need to start.

  

Trolls don't take offence. You don't want to ruin the brand. It's a slippery slope. Don't try so hard if you can't do it.

**Vladimir Karputov:**  
   

Trolls aren't supposed to take offence. You don't want to ruin the brand. It's a slippery slope. Don't try so hard if you can't do it.

  

Should I complain to service desk about your rudeness?

Or will you stop? I'm not talking about apologising.

Adherents of the old terminal have been deprived of support. As punishment for laziness.

Are you even sane?
