This is a script version of this: https://www.mql5.com/en/code/51877

Dialogs aren't really used in scripts, but a small graphical panel of information was created to display the maximum lot size permitted. The max lot size is based on your account size and leverage, and this is calculated from the free margin. Some may not want to load an expert advisor to fetch the information if it can be fetched through a script.

Hello,

Can you write the following software:

If I have a LOT max that corresponds to Free Margin.

I have three orders with:

LOT1;   
LOT2 = LOT1 x 2;   
LOT3 = LOT1 x 3;

How do I calculate LOT1 max so that all three orders are placed?

Thanks in advance.

LotsTotal = Lot1 + Lot2 + Lot3 = Lot1 + ( Lot1 \* 2 ) + ( Lot \* 3 ) = Lot1 \* ( 1 + 2 + 3) = Lot1 \* 6

Lot1 = LotsTotal / 6

As for the code, either learn to code it, or study this or other [CodeBase](/en/code) examples, or hire someone in the [Freelance](/en/job) section.

You don't have to write a new program for this. First place your position with the x3 lot size, next place your position with the x2 lot size, and now when you run the script again it will automatically calculate the remaining max lots that are available to use.

But if you want to execute those positions starting with LOT1, then just take the advice of Fernando above.
