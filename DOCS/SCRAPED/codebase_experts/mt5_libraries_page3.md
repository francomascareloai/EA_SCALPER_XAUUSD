# MQL5 Source Codes of Libraries for MetaTrader 5 - 3

![icon](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/code-icon.png)

Libraries are small sub-programs containing a certain functionality that can then be used for developing new applications. Once written and thoroughly checked, a library allows users to speed up the development of new MQL5 applications. One of the illustrative examples is ALGLIB library containing multiple numerical analysis functions.

Library source codes can be downloaded and used in MetaEditor when developing trading strategies. They cannot be launched in MetaTrader 5 independently.

An (optional) include file to enhance debugging experience.

[observer (pull model) - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/32023 "observer (pull model) - behavioral design pattern")

define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

[observer (push) - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31796 "observer (push) - behavioral design pattern")

define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

[Memento - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31766 "Memento - behavioral design pattern")

without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later

[Mediator - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31659 "Mediator - behavioral design pattern")

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently

[Iterator - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31579 "Iterator - behavioral design pattern")

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

[Interpreter - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31488 "Interpreter - behavioral design pattern")

Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language

[Log4mql (MT5)](/en/code/31452 "Log4mql (MT5)")

A logging library similar to Log4j but for MQL.

[Command - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31361 "Command - behavioral design pattern")

Encapsulate a request as an object thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests. Queue or log requests, and support undoable operations

[Chain of responsibility - behavioral design pattern](/en/code/31259 "Chain of responsibility - behavioral design pattern")

Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it

[Proxy - structural design pattern](/en/code/31159 "Proxy - structural design pattern")

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it

[Flyweight - structural design pattern](/en/code/31061 "Flyweight - structural design pattern")

Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently

[Facade - structural design pattern](/en/code/31059 "Facade - structural design pattern")

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem; facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use

[Decorator - structural design pattern](/en/code/30969 "Decorator - structural design pattern")

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically; and provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality

[Composite - structural design pattern](/en/code/30884 "Composite - structural design pattern")
