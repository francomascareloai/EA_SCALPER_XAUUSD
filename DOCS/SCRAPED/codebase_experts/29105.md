The VR Sync Chart Lite indicator is written for demonstration purposes and shows how it is possible to synchronize the rectangle object (OBJ\_RECTANGLE) on all open charts in the MetaTrader terminal.

For convenience, we recommend installing the indicator on all charts.

The indicator code is written simply and clearly.

Hi,

If I move the rectangle in bigger time frame, then it goes outside the visible range in smaller time frame (smaller time frame chart does not move to make it visible).

Is it possible to make two charts synchoronise at the same time?

Thanks

Hello, Vladimir, I need help. The indicator wasn't showing up on the charts, and the background on all pairs had changed to blue. The background on the pairs I didn't use the indicator on also changed.

This is very strange. Please correct the code and let me know when you've corrected it so I can download the [controllable](/en/articles/310 "Article: Custom Graphic Controls Part 1. Creating a simple control") indicator.
