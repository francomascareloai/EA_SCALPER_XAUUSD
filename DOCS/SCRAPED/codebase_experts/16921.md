TrendMeLeaveMe is a MetaTrader 5 EA. The semi-automated Expert Advisor using a trend line (TrendLIne).

Before launching the EA, simply draw a bullish or a bearish trend. Set the properties, launch the EA and you are free to focus your attention on something else.

This is an automated EA. First, you should draw an upward, downward or horizontal trend:

![Trend Line](https://c.mql5.com/18/55/TrendMeLeaveMe_Trend_Line.png "Trend Line")

Name it **buystop** or **sellstop** and set the **BuyStop\_StepUpper**, **BuyStop\_StepLower**, **SellStop\_StepUpper** and **SellStop\_StepLower** parameters 

When the price enters the area between your buystop and BuyStop\_StepLower levels, the EA opens a buystop order following the BuyStop\_StepUpper price. When the price enters the area between your sellstop and SellStop\_StepUpper levels, the EA opens a sellstop order following the SellStop\_StepLower price.   
  
The EA always changes the OpenPrice for both order types when the price follows a trend till it leaves the displayed area.

Thank you very much...I've wanted such a thing for a long time...I'd also like to have such channels in the form of a script to work on expiry, while I need them on all owls, where you can put such a corridor.... or another idea: can't it be tied to bolinger bands, upper and lower say as average...something like a double corridor for buoys and sells????
