The strategy is based on signals generated by two indicators calculated on different timeframes: iAO (Awesome Oscillator, AO) on the D1 TF and iStochastic (Stochastic Oscillator, Stoh) on H1.

The signal is formed in two steps. Example of a BUY signal:

* Step one. On the higher timeframe, wait for the iAO to cross "0.0" on the bar #1
* Step two. Start searching for a moment when iStochastic on the bar #1 at a lower TF falls below the specified level of "-20.0"

Hi Mr Vladimir,   
  
 for daytrade I think it would be useful to add a start time (for example: 08:00) and an end time (for example: 22:30) in the next version update ... tks

No. In this code you cannot limit the time interval: after Step 1, Step 2 is started. And Step 2 can last all day long - until the iStochastic[Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so "MetaTrader 5 Help: Stochastic Oscillator Indicator")([Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so "MetaTrader 5 Help: Stochastic Oscillator Indicator"), Stoh) indicator on H1 crosses UP or DOWN.
