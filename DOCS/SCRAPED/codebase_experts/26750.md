For everybody's knowledge, this template could be used 'as is' for trading purpose but not recommended as there needs more to it! It's a basic
starter template were you are supposed to do further development on your own as you like.

[ZigZag Based on Close Prices](/en/code/26742)

The code is based on indicator ZigZag which is in-built in MT4.
I have changed it so that it isn't calculated on highest Highs and lowest Lows, but instead uses highest Close and lowest Close of chart price history.
See attached chart for differences: ZigZag (red) versus ZigZagClose (yellow).
