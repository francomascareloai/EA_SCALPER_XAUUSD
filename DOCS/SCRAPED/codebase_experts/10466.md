It has lot of bugs and errors. I have placed it on EURUSD but it sends reports of all currency close trades mentioning its EURUSD whether its of EURGBP or EURJPY or [USDCHF](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/usdchf "USDCHF chart: technical analysis") or any currency. It also having error in calculating pips. Its good for those who trades only in one currency. And that currency chart we need to open twice. one for Trading EA and other for emailing EA. **so many errors but nice try.**

Perfect solution for newcomers at coding. Allows to implement strategies with difficult stop-management. Yes, this thing need some "baking", i.e. editing, but you will like the result; especially if the strategy is already tested with hands.
