**vaclav:**  

What is difference between this indicator and i-Trend? Isn´t it the same?

I don't know - what is the i-Trend? Please understand, all I did was take the information from the TASC article and code the indicator in MQL4. Whether the Vortex Indicator resembles the i-Trend or any other indicator, other than the DMI (as stated by the authors of the article), I cannot say.

To me it looks exactly the same as the DMI, iTrend and other clones. I doubt they are coded similarly using the same calculations but the results seem very close. This is the problem we're faced with when comparing indicators. So many are so much alike. For me the most reliable things to use are tools such as Gann, Fibonacci and support and resistance. That is not to say I think this indicator is of no use. It obviously is for some traders or they would not say it was good at showing potential reversals?

Question: When using it as a reversal indicator when do you then enter? Or is this another way of saying it has false signals and we're not responsible for that. Perhaps it is better described as a volatility indicator, or to show the trend once price has already confirmed this several bars ago.

I haven't tested this indicator as of yet but if I find it is out of the ordinary I will be sure to post back here.
