**Fine Fractal Channel**

A quick gluejob of two simple but useful indicators. Requires [FineFractals](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/9136) by Denis Orlov.

* Useful for fractal breakouts and to visualize almost all Support/Resistance lines.
* Sits nicely inside Fractal Channel to give more signals.

no big deal but this is as it should be

```mql5
       val1 = iCustom(NULL, 0, "Fine_Fractals",0,i);
       if(val1 > 0) v1[i] = val1; //High[i];
       else v1[i] = v1[i+1]; 
       //----
       val2 = iCustom(NULL, 0, "Fine_Fractals",1,i);
       if(val2 > 0) v2[i] = val2; //Low[i];
       else v2[i] = v2[i+1];
       //----
```

 ..I was adapting this to a mod. of my own and didn't get why it would not work so, this was what I needed to correct

This a very cool indicator. Very similar to Gann Swing oscillator. I wish you could be able to create the Gann Swing Oscillator for MT4 platform.

![Open and Close positions using the lines](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Open and Close positions using the lines](/en/code/9347)

It opens and closes positions using the crossing of the movable lines.

![Opened positions indicator](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Opened positions indicator](/en/code/9283)

It shows a brief information about all of the positions opened. It can be useful, if yours expert advisor trades many positions simultaneously.

![Average Stocastic indicator for several timeframes](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Average Stocastic indicator for several timeframes](/en/code/9352)

It shows Stochastics for several timeframes in a single chart, also it calculates the average value.

[10 points on EURUSD & GBPUSD](/en/code/9321)

The strategy is based on breakthrough of the maximum and minimum price values of the previous trading day.
