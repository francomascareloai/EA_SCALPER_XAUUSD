A trading system based on the signals of the [ColorFisher\_m11](/en/code/18771 "ColorFisher_m11 - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator. A signal to open a position is generated at the close of a bar if the color of the histogram has changed to blue or pink, i.e. when the oscillator has entered the overbought or oversold zone. The position closing signal is formed when the histogram color changes to opposite.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file ColorFisher\_m11.ex5 in order to run. Add it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **during position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578 "TradeAlgorithms - Library for MetaTrader 5").

Default input parameters of the Expert Advisor were used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit were not used during testing.

Good afternoon.

Tested on the period D1 liked it. I ask only to clarify now I will put MM from the balance of funds on the account.

Question the volume of the bet is calculated as =

Share of financial resources **\* MM** from the balance of funds on the account ?

Sir, financial markets are not casinos and there are no bets on them! In this context, the words should be taken literally, as they are. The share of financial resources from the balance of funds in the account is the Share of financial resources from the balance of funds. If you have it equal to one, then the whole deposit is invested in the deal, and if it is equal to 0.5, then half of the deposit.
