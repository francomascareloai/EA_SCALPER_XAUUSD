The Expert Advisor is based on the [iRSI](/en/docs/indicators/irsi "MQL5 Reference → Technical Indicators → iRSI") (Relative Strength Index, RSI) indicator signals. Inspired by the forum topic at [https://www.mql5.com/ru/forum/219752](/ru/forum/219752) (in Russian).

### Input Parameters

* **RSI: averaging period**
* **Stop Loss**
* **Risk in percent for a deal from a free margin**

Position volume is calculated as percent of free margin, **Stop Loss** is specified in input parameters.

### Conditions for opening BUY trades

1. Entering a buy trade if RSI is above 50% on the H1 timeframe and the stop loss size condition is met (See p.3);
2. The EA enters the market once a day. There can be one buy trade and one sell trade per day;
3. If the calculated stop loss exceeds the **Stop Loss** parameter, the entry signal should be ignored. Stop loss is equal to the low of the previous daily bar minus 10 points;
4. Take profit is three times the size of the stop loss;
5. Moving to breakeven if the price has passed a distance in the positive direction which is not less than the stop loss size;
6. If there is an [open position](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "MetaTrader 5 Help → Trading Operations → Performing Trades: Position Management") that was opened yesterday or earlier, signals to open a new position will be handled. If the open position was opened today, signals will be ignored;0
7. Sell conditions are opposite.
