Andrey Sigitov:

Nikolay, hello! I like your oscillator very much. Can I ask you to make a function - crossing levels 70 and 30 signal to email. It would simplify the task of constant presence at the monitor (AlertsEmail true/false ). More precisely, if the histogram bar has closed with the value =70 and above, or =30 and below, then a letter to the mail. There can be many intersections during the formation of the bar..... Thanks in advance!
