**wescot2000:**  

Hi klam2404,

I think your robot "10 Point 3 v004 enhanced" is excelent!! But it requires a little adjustment I guess... If you places a stop loss in the value of the input parameter "InitialStop" the robot does not work!!! Without this parameter, in a trend change, I've lost all the money in the demo account. In conclusion: It needs a stop loss on each transaction to avoid a fall to 0 and lose all the money.

[![](https://c.mql5.com/3/36/TesterGraph_6_small__2.gif "The robot fails after winning on a trend change")](https://c.mql5.com/3/36/TesterGraph_6__2.gif)

Other example, you can use the test period between may 4 2010 to may 7 2010 and you'll see what I'm talking about:

[![](https://c.mql5.com/3/36/TesterGraph2_small__1.gif "Winning... and fall")](https://c.mql5.com/3/36/TesterGraph2__1.gif)

This robot is awesome, really awesome, it wins quickly, only needs fix that... congratulations!!!

  
I'm sorry, I correct: the stop loss is working well. The problem appears in large retractions after a very strong trend!! The robot should not launch transactions at that time or it should to trade in the retraction direction.

This is after all a simple Martingale with large StopLoss, so users beware!  
I had posted on the other thread that I would add a value for InitialStop of 50 (500 on sub-pip)  
After reading the code again I would make that 5 (50 on a sub-pip) as there are several factors that ramp up the total STopLoss distance  
Also I would consider limiting the MaxOpenOrders to 5 or 6

For info on Martingales, see:-
