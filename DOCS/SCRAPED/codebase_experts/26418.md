**iskander\_osp:**  
 Ok thank you. So should I immediately close trades with no TP and SL after I see them?

you can either close them, or try changing your SL and TP values. you can also try setting them manually.

Lot size 0.01 is minimum accepted by brokers. That is why you can not open smaller lot´s.

Nice EA sir!

Can I add suggestion, instead of reversing order can it be change to something condition like when two EMA for example; if EMA 1 > EMA 2 put buy or the other way around.

That would be great if you can share it or rather teach me to modify it, thanks..
