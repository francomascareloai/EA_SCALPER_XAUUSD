Two identical trading systems based on the change in the color of [XFatlXSatlCloud](/en/code/16163 "XFatlXSatlCloud - indicator for MetaTrader 5") for long and short trades, which can be configured in different ways in one Expert Advisor. For this purpose, all input parameters can be divided into two large groups:

1. Parameters starting with the letter L are used for managing long positions
2. Parameters starting with the letter S are used for managing short positions

```mql5
//+----------------------------------------------+
//| EA's input parameters for long positions     |
//+----------------------------------------------+
input uint    L_Magic=777;          //L magic number
input double  L_MM=0.1;             //L share of a deposit per trade
input MarginMode L_MMMode=LOT;      //L lot setting mode
//+----------------------------------------------+
//| EA's input parameters for short positions    |
//+----------------------------------------------+
input uint    S_Magic=555;          //S magic number
input double  S_MM=0.1;             //S share of a deposit per trade
input MarginMode S_MMMode=LOT;      //S lot setting mode
```

Different magic numbers are used for these trading systems, so they are two independent systems. Real financial markets are rarely symmetric. Different parameters of the same trading systems are often needed for trading in the rising and falling market. To properly configure the EA, you should first test only one trading system and disable the second one using special switchers.

```mql5
input bool    L_PosOpen=true;       //L permission to enter long positions
input bool    L_PosClose=true;      //L permission to exit long positions
```

After that perform the same for the second system.

For a correct operation of the Expert Advisor, you should save the XFatlXSatlCloud.ex5 compiled indicator file to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Default input parameters of the Expert Advisor were used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit were not used during testing.

This is something new! The logic of the code is as simple as a rake. If there is already an [open position](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") with a particular magik, the Expert Advisor will not open a second position with the same magik.

That's the point, I opened 6 sell trades on one magik at once. And then the Expert Advisor closed only one deal out of 6 open deals, and the other 5 did not close. Maybe there is a bug? When testing in MT5 tester there is nothing like this.

Maybe the magicians were different, or maybe they didn't exist at all? [Closing positions](https://www.metatrader5.com/ru/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") would have [closed](https://www.metatrader5.com/ru/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") the other five without any hassle. That makes two whole bugs, and unrealistic ones at that.

I renamed the magics so that they would not repeat on each currency pair. The Expert Advisor was placed on 7 different currency pairs. Naturally, magiks are different everywhere so that they do not interfere with each other's work.

And in general, this bug happened only 3 times, the other times, about 70 open trades, everything was normal, all one by one opened and closed as it should.

Is there a log file? According to all signs, [positions](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") without magik [are open](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal"), because with magik they would have been closed unambiguously.

 Do you have a log file? By all indications [, positions are open](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") without magik, because with magik they would have been closed unambiguously.

Unfortunately, the log is not saved. But there was a magician anyway. So the main time it works normally, and only 3 times it happened.

I tested the Expert Advisor on MQ5 FPS.
