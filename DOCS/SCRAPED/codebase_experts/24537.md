This EA uses your key pressing effort to execute what you want to do..

There is no GLOBAL ACTION which will effect your account and other chart in which do not contain this EA;

Please be careful about TO ADD GLOBAL ACTIONS/EXECUTIONS (which will effect your account / portfolio) into ANY EA ; since I have terrible experiences to do so..

I RECOMMEND USE ANOTHER EA FOR THAT EXECUTIONS..

Hi,

Please change the following original lines

...

// ----------------------      
   MOVETOBREAKEVEN();

...

as Follows

so it can be [controlled](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/310 "Article: Custom Graphic Controls Part 1. Creating a simple control") action by EA :

...

// ----------------------      
   if( USE\_TRAIL\_STOP == true ) MOVETOBREAKEVEN();  
// ----------------------

...
