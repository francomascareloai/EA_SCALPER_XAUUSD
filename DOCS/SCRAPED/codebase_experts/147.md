I wrote this Expert Advisor for checking of the effectiveness trading during the night.

An Expert Advisor trades on EURUSD (M15), according the signals of [Stochastic](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so) indicator. It uses a simple money management system.

**jmfx:**  

Hello,

Here my test. Look at any hours what are out of the range of time !

And the server time is no different of my clock. It's the same.

Do you know what a trade is ? all trades are **opened** between 21h and 6h in the report you posted. Sometimes they are closed outside this time range.

I am agree, I saw on the graphic, it's ok  
but on the list, par example, order 5 open at 16:16

Did I miss something?

Order 5 resulted to a Buy deal, who **closed** the Sell position previously opened.
