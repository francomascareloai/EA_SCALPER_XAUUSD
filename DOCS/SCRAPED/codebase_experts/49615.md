This particular expert advisor contains a very useful code which is often required by the developers. Most of the time , we need the last closed trade. But in this EA you can search a trade with any index.

By active trade ,I mean market orders not pending orders

if you pass 0 then it will fetch the most recent active trade

If you pass 1 then it will fetch the trade before that and so on.

We can filter  the trades based on symbol and magic number.

It is called MQL5, you need to have a knowledge of Object oriented programming in any programming language. It is quite similar to C++.
