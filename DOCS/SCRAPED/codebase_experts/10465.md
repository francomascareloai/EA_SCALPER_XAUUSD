Very high drawdown, and a lot of Mismatched charts errors. An increasing lotsize always risky

"USDJYP" if (Symbol() == "USDJYP") Won't work on my account

"EURJYP" if (Symbol() == "EURJYP") Won't work

Also if (Symbol() == "[EURUSD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/eurusd "EURUSD chart: technical analysis")") Is not working on a lot of accounts Miss prefix and suffix solution to open a trade

Also Magicnumber trade This EA will not work properly with other EA's

There is no solution for 4digit or 5digit brokers..... (For JPY 2 or 3 Digit brokers)

Good luck learning code
