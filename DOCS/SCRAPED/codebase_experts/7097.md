At least one position is opened in each direction. First, open two counterpositions with minimal volumes. One of them becomes profitable, whereas the second one loses, of course.

The profitable one will be closed by TakeProfit, and the losing one will be strengthened (by adding lots) at a certain interval. If the trend continues to go in the same direction, strengthen it again. The trend will turn earlier or later.

Every step of strengthening is mde with doubling of the volume, so, after the trend has truned, the last losing position closed by TakeProfit will cover everything with a positive result. Then the operations start with the same: opening with the minimal volume and then step by step as described above.

the lots in 50% dlmv… The positions opened only need to close all in sell or buy where to reach tp equal to
the EA 10point3. Peace to the all.

when this EA is turned on, how do you adjust or make it enter both sides at the
same exact time?

also, when it is turned on...it buys X and sells X. when the price moves, it adjusts
the trade. TP on the profitable one, opens new similar position, and doubles the
volume of the losing side of the trade...which is fine. let's say you turn it on,
price goes up and it adjusts the trade. how do you make the EA adjust the TP on
the open losing postion to the same TP on the portion of the trade it adds when
doubling the volume?
