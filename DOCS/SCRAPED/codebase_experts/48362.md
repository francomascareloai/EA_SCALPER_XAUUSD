Having desired to work with SQLite database for the purpose of storing my statistical generated from simulations, i noticed very early that it seems very challenging and time consuming to work with database built in functions. I then decided to create a simplified class and functions to make my work easy.

To use the class a developer simple has to include the file in the code, call object databases.xxxxfunction\_name().

It has served me very well in extracting and saving thousands of datapoints.

Thanks.

That is not possible....

MQL5 is limited in this case, and you cannot solve it generic, like ReadBind does.
