Second code from my side (you can find the other one under name of "Very Blondie System"). Similar idea, different approach.

This time the EA gets two points and keeps on hedging between this two points. The size of the hedge is under the parameter "Anchor" (in the chart below I used 250 (5 digits)).  
The increase factor is decided by the "xFactor" parameter. The higher the riskier of course. I was good at 1.7-1.8.

There is also an option to have it set manually which should give you higher precision in the entry (right now the entry is pretty much random, so big room for improvement).

What I like from this EA is that in the wrong case you find yourseld with opposite positions open and you can still decide your trend and perform a manual intervention.

Happy to hear your feedback.

Kind Regards

David

Hi Bluesky,

amazing! I have tried the same concept (guess we got the idea from the same place) but my code... well let's say no use publishing it next to yours. Absolutely amazed. Could I suggest two things:

- base the automated system on equity, not balance.

- when Ordersend 130 occurs (ie Stopout is imminent if trend continues and manual interference does not follow), place an order that in effect levels sells vs. buys? Ie if open 3.4lot buy and 4.3lot sell and the buystop cannot convert instead open a buy of 0.9 to make buy and sell even?

I could share something that is modified accordingly if that is ok.

Kind Regards, and again: kudos!

Chris

can you please share it. i have an idea on how it should also work.

Is anybody working with this EA? I just started it, looks good.

As it seems too old a post, was there any problem with this EA?

The idea is very good  
The code is simple

but the code does'nt include protection against the market environnement

- No protection for the margin

- No protection against the error when order settings

I keep this code and i'm going to work with.

Thank you for your job
