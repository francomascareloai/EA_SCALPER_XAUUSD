This is an MQL5 version of the Expert Advisor from the article "[How to reduce trader's risks](/en/articles/4233 "How to reduce trader's risks - MQL5 Articles")".

The EA works on each tick and can be optimized:

* Get some data (on indicators and time series) only if a new bar appears

Sample tester runs with the appropriate settings (the terminal was relaunched before each test, the caches were not cleared):

![Reduce_risks Tester Settings](https://c.mql5.com/18/63/Reduce_risks_Tester_Settings.png "Reduce_risks Tester Settings")

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | EURUSD,M1: 90097615 ticks, 1090402 bars generated. Environment synchronized in 0:00:00.173. Test passed in 0:08:34.093 (including ticks preprocessing 0:00:29.109) |
| 2 | EURUSD,M1: 90097615 ticks, 1090402 bars generated. Environment synchronized in 0:00:00.047. Test passed in 0:08:20.531 (including ticks preprocessing 0:00:28.453) |
| 3 | EURUSD,M1: 90097615 ticks, 1090402 bars generated. Environment synchronized in 0:00:00.031. Test passed in 0:07:56.172 (including ticks preprocessing 0:00:30.969) |

Below is the graph before the code optimization:

![Reduce_risks Tester Graph](https://c.mql5.com/18/63/Reduce_risks_Tester_Graph.png "Reduce_risks Tester Graph")

Now, three runs after a small code optimization:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | EURUSD,M1: 90097615 ticks, 1090402 bars generated. Environment synchronized in 0:00:00.047. Test passed in 0:06:25.609 (including ticks preprocessing 0:00:30.750) |
| 2 | EURUSD,M1: 90097615 ticks, 1090402 bars generated. Environment synchronized in 0:00:00.047. Test passed in 0:06:20.875 (including ticks preprocessing 0:00:28.743) |
| 3 | EURUSD,M1: 90097615 ticks, 1090402 bars generated. Environment synchronized in 0:00:00.043. Test passed in 0:06:15.305 (including ticks preprocessing 0:00:27.475) |

As we can see, now that some variables are declared with 'static' type and re-written on a new bar only, we can save 2 minutes.

The attached file of the version 1.013 contains the optimized code.
