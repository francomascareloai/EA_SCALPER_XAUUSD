The trading system based on the [X2MACandle](/en/code/22272 "ColorXPWMA_Digit - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator signals with an ability to change the volume of a forthcoming trade depending on the results of the previous trades for this trading system. Trading signals are formed when a bar closes if a trend has changed (which is displayed by candles changing their color).

The block of input EA variables is added for managing volumes of opened positions:

```mql5
input uint    BuyTotalMMTriger=3; // The number of the last Buy deals to calculate stop loss
input uint    BuyLossMMTriger=2;  // The number of losing Buy deals to reduce MM
input uint    SellTotalMMTriger=3;// The number of the last Sell deals to calculate stop loss
input uint    SellLossMMTriger=2; // The number of losing Sell deals to reduce MM
input double  SmallMM_=0.01;      // Share of a deposit in a deal in case of loss
input double  MM=0.1;             // Share of a deposit in a deal during normal trading
input MarginMode MMMode=LOT;      // Lot value determining method
```

In case of such inputs and when selecting from the last five trades, three of which are loss-making in a single direction, the EA opens the next trade in the same direction having the volume of 0.01 lot. If there are less than three loss-making trades out of the last five ones, the position volume is 0.1.

For the generated EA to operate correctly, the compiled files of indicators **X2MA.ex5** and **X2MACandle.ex5** should be present in the **<terminal\_data\_directory>\MQL5\Indicators**.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters without stops have been used during tests shown below.
