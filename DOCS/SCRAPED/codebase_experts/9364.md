**ADDED:**

**Added ability to run your own MQL script automatically in case of non-market quotations have place. To work correctly, your script Assign hot keys (alt-b).**

**You should record the full names of the two MetaTrader windows in the file programs.txt. It allows the application know where to send the combination Alt + b. The example given the file programs.txt.   
  
After performing these steps, write the script that you would like to run in case of non-market quotations have place and copy it to the scripts of the second terminal (inscribed the second in programs.txt).**

The program is intended for logging of non-market quotations from brokerage companies with MetaTrader platform.   
The program works with two MetaTraders. Quotations from these two are transmitted through advisers Chart1.mq4 and Chart2.mq4 to external application.

Then run advisers are interested in the pair in both MetaTrader platforms. And run c:ChartPlusChar tChartPlusChart .exe.

It works without losses. It uses the market inefficiency for the arbitrage.

Use on 1M charts. Manually choose Only Long, Only Short or Short and Long depending on market direction. Close open orders moving in the opposite direction.
