**Jordan Mullin:**  
 What is the premise of this indicator? What is it measuring?

```mql5
 MathLog((1.0+Value[shift])/(1.0-Value[shift]))/2.0 + Fisher[shift+1]/2.0;


```

  

This is a [Sigmoid Function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_machine_learning/matrix_activation "MQL5 Documentation: function Activation")...it calculate base on Log

```mql5

this is the heart of output signal from this indicator ... you can transform this kind of indicator into a function and let the function decide to give buy / [sell signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/591 "Article: How to Become a Signal Provider for MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 ") to your EA...
