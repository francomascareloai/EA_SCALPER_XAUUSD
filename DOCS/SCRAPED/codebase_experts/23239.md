The Expert Advisor uses two iMA (Moving Average, MA) indicators and one iRSI (Relative Strength Index, RSI). One of the iMAs uses the MODE\_EMA [averaging method](/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/enum_ma_method), the second one uses MODE\_LWMA (the averaging method cannot be changed, because the idea of the trading system is exactly in using such methods).

The EA operates at a new bar opening and opens only one position at a time, therefore it is able to work both on hedging and netting accounts.

BUY open signal serves as a SELL close signal and vice versa: Sell open signal serves as a BUY close one.
