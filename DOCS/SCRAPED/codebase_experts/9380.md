**Jays candle display is a multi candle displaying indicator.**

It displays the swing and body of candles on different timeframes from one minute up to one day.

If the candle is a bear candle, the numbers will be displayed in red and green for bull candles.

There is an option for you to change which candle you want to
observe. By default, this indicator shows the current candle, but if
you want to observe the previous candle, you need to change the candle
shift to 1. If you change the candle shift to 2, it will display the
candle 2steps away from the current candle.

This indicator will be particularly useful for traders who rely on
statistics heavily as they will see at a glance the movements of the
selected candles.

There are 2 columns; **Body** and **SwinG**.

The body tells you how many pips the candle moved from open to
close. Another way of looking at it would be to say how many pips you
would have gained if you had entered at the opening in the correct
direction and stayed till the close off the candle.

The swing is simply the entire movement of the candle obtained by
subtracting the high from the low of each of the displayed candles.

It's a great indicator I like seeing multiple time frames at once and the price action.  Only have one complaint is that you have copy writed everything so I cannot make any changes in the settings of the indicator to display the time frames I want.   Also the "M5" min time frame is really the time for the M15 min candle and when I realized that I have been trying to change the text from M5 to M15 but cannot because again everything is copywrited and the indicator won't let me.  Other than that I really enjoy the indicator.  Just need to be able to fix those things I mentioned and I would be excellent!

The script shows the price level, where total profit for all of the opened positions will be non-negative (without loss level, or break-even price level).
