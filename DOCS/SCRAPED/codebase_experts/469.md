Camarilla Equation system was implemented by Nick Stott at the end of 1980s.

Camarilla Equation consists of 8 or 10 levels (in later modifications) calculated by using Open, Close, High and Low prices of a previous trading session and a set of instructions on the application of these levels in trading.

The levels are divided in two groups. The first one is built downwards from the yesterday's Close price, indicated by L symbol (for "Low") and numbered from 1 to 5. Similarly, the second group of levels is built upwards from the yesterday's Close price, indicated by H symbol (for "High") and also numbered from 1 to 5.

It should be noted that levels 1 and 2 have comparatively small value and are often not considered. As for L5 and H5 levels, they should always be considered, though they are ignored in some sources.

Camarilla Equation levels are calculated the following way:

H1 = close + (high-low)\*1.1 /12  
H2 = close + (high-low)\*1.1 /6  
H3 = close + (high-low)\*1.1 /4  
H4 = close + (high-low)\*1.1 /2

Hello.

I have a small request to you to finalise your tool, if possible.

Can you add such functions as:

- GMT time correction, say up to 14 hours in both directions.

- Possibility of manual input of initial parameters (high low opening and closing) without time reference.

- display of information in some corner of the platform - from what parameters the indicator works and the level of the current move for a given period, say, if you take a daily one, how many pips have already passed at the [current time](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/dateandtime/timecurrent "MQL5 documentation: TimeCurrent function"), what high low and open and close took for calculation

-add a function of simple pivot levels with their display (standard pivot and three or up to 5 pivots and supports)

- function of picture saving (there are such moments on weekends when it is necessary to save it till the beginning of the next day, because it will calculate a piece of Sunday, and Monday passes in manual mode of calculation).

Why do I ask such a thing? The whole point is that almost on all platforms, the time is distorted, it does not correspond to the time on which the whole world trades, you have to calculate everything on a calculator and then put it on the chart manually. Consequently, the tools move and sometimes significantly, although calculated by hand - work well enough, especially if you intertwine several periods (day, week, month) coincidence of say two H3 different-period give almost impenetrable resistance, sootvetstvo and entrances at such times can be made without particularly observing MM.

Of course, if all this is possible, I, for example, use two of your tools, this and Full, very convenient, thank you for your work.
