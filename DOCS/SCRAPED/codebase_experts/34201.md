AutoTrading Scheduler expert advisor for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com.

AutoTrading Scheduler lets you control the time periods when AutoTrading is enabled or disabled in your MetaTrader.

You can set time periods for each of the days of the week and it will automatically disable AutoTrading outside those periods.

It can also attempt to close all trades (both open positions and pending orders) before disabling AutoTrading.

It's quite simple. Open a new window on any currency pair (e.g. [EURUSD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/eurusd "EURUSD chart: technical analysis")).

Drag the Auto Scheduler EA over to and drop it on the window; the settings box will automatically open, everything should be set by default.

But just to be certain, make sure 'Enalbe Auto Trading' and 'Allow DLL Import' are enabled - then click OK.

The schedule panel pops up on top of the currency chart; configure the schedule there - it's self explanatory.

When I drag in onto the chart nothing happens? Are there errors in the EA? I have copied the .mqh files into the /Include folder. Anyone knows how to make it work or has a [working version](/go?link=https://forge.mql5.io/help/en/guide "MQL5 Algo Forge: Cloud Workspace for Algorithmic Trading Development")? Thx - Johan

Check for any errors in the Experts tab when you attach it and it doesn't work. You probably need to compile it.
