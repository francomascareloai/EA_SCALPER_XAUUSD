Script to create wide screenshots when monitor width is not enough to see the overall picture in terminal.

The length of resulting image is 1500 bars. This is enough to fit the entire M1 day in one screenshot. This is handy for situation post-analysis.

The script automatically calculates width of image file and adjusts chart minimum/maximum into screenshot boundaries.

**Screenshot is produced in the following way:** Set left border of image and run the script. Files are saved in the ..../MQL5/Files/ folder.

Thanks for the script and adequate code comment!

It would be nice to be able to set a time range for the screenshot. I understand that screenshots are taken on the current screen, but how to position it to take an image is a mystery to me - can you help me solve it?

I can do a lot of things, but if you could answer a simple question publicly, that would be the thing!

Very useful script, thank you )))))).

By the way - please improve the script:   
 line 57 int scr\_height=(int)ChartGetInteger(0[,CHART\_HEIGHT\_IN\_PIXELS](/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chart_property#enum_chart_property_integer "MQL5 Documentation: Chart Properties"))\*6;   
 at the end of the line I added a MULTIPLE (\*6) and the height of the screen became MUCH HIGHER, which is much COMFORTABLE for perception ! :)

... and also here : line 11 int bars=5000,KF=1;

I changed the value of 1500 bars to 5000 bars and in combination with increasing the screen height - I got quite CLASSY widescreens in 16:9 format, but better when 10:4,5 :).

BUT :   
 1) at such increased height - many LOW or TOP bars are not included in the screen :( they just remain "outside the chart.   
 2) depending on the WIDTH of the main chart window, where the Script is applied - the WIDTH of the screen itself changes (!)   
 here are 2 examples : in both cases - history period = about 4000 - 5000 bars :

- if the width of the main window is WIDE (4/5 of the whole monitor width), then the screens are narrow, a little wider than the screen part of the chart (!) ....

- but if the width of the main window of the chart is narrow - about 1/5 of the monitor width - then the screen is VERY LONG, the whole chart is bunched in the left half of the screen, and the whole right half of the screen = empty (!) :( please check it, and please make the appropriate corrections and improvements, Thank you :).

**Also, please add :**

1) function of "determining the current scale of the chart window". and when creating a screen - to keep the screen height in the format 10:4,5 depending on the calculated screen width (!).

2) on the screen - on the right - adjust the "ruler" so that the Grid is always a multiple of 50 points for the Symbol chart !  
*(because the Price Step there is often SHIFTED - not x.xxxx50, but x.xxxx38 .... and HOW to calculate it ?! ) :(*

Thank you ))

Correction :

**Vitaliy Kostrubko [#](/ru/forum/7324#comment_53157100) 8:**

**Also PROPOSED - to add :**

1) the function of "determining the current scale of the chart window". and when creating a screen - to keep the height of the screen in the format 10:4,5 depending on the calculated screen width (!).

2) on the screen - on the right - adjust the "ruler" so ( or rather the height of the chart in front of the screen) that the Grid step is always a multiple of 50 / 100 / 250 / 500 points for the Symbol chart !  
*(because the Price Step there is often MIXED - not x.xxxx50, but x.xxxx38 ... and HOW to calculate it ?! ) :(*

Thank you :)
