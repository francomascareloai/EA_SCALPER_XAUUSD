**Idea by:** [Scriptor](/en/users/scriptor "Scriptor")

**Code mq5 by:** [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn)

The EA works both on netting and hedging accounts. It places pending orders only when a new bar appears.

**What It Makes**

First, three parameters (**Hour 1**, **Hour 2**, and **Hour 3**) are compared to the current hour. If the current hour matches one of these parameters, placing pending orders is allowed.

Maximum and minimum prices between bars #0 and #1 are defined. After that, the value of indicator iATR is added to the maximum price of bar #0. This is how the Buy stop price is obtained. Price for Sell stop is obtained by subtracting the value of indicator iATR on bar #0 from the minimum price.

![LBS](https://c.mql5.com/18/76/LBS.png "LBS")

The volume can be set in two ways: by either using a fixed lot (set **Money management** to **Constant lot**) or in in risk % per trade (set **Money management** to **Risk in percent for a deal**).

As soon as one of the pending orders is activated (defined in OnTradeTransaction: TRADE\_TRANSACTION\_DEAL\_ADD transaction type – "adding a deal to history" is detected), all remaining pending orders are removed.

Trailing is applied to positions.
