Why would anybody trade without a [stop loss](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders")? I am allergic to the statement...it always comes back....The author reccommends no stop loss for this EA. Will the indicators close the trade? there must be some mechanism to close the trades because his detailed report above shows activity in the consecutive loss field.

This EA simply does not put a stopless in hope that price rate would come back to its flavor point some day in the future! DO NOT use such EA with your real money, or you would expect to [get margin](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/trading/ordercalcmargin "MQL5 Documentation: Function OrderCalcMargin") called!
