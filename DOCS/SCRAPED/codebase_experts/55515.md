**Support and Resistance MetaTrader indicator** — as the name of this indicator suggests, it displays the support and resistance levels. It shows them directly on the chart, providing an easy help when you want to set stop-loss or take-profit level, or when you want to see the next market target. This indicator uses the standard MetaTrader Fractals indicator (by Bill Williams' method) and has no changeable input parameters. This indicator is available for MetaTrader version 4 and 5.

## Input parameters

* **EnableNativeAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, a native MetaTrader popup alert will be used when price closes above or below the support or resistance level.
* **EnableEmailAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent when price closes above or below the support or resistance level. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **EnablePushAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent when price closes above or below the support or resistance level. Notifications should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications*.
* **TriggerCandle** (default = Previous) — the candle to issue alerts on: *Previous* — the most recently closed candle or *Current* — the yet unfinished candle.

[Schaff Trend Cycle MT5](/en/code/55511)

Schaff Trend Cycle (MetaTrader indicator) — is a cyclical oscillator created by calculating the stochastic over stochastic over a MACD line using cycles. The result is the improved version of the oscillator that is not choppy during the trends and reacts to the changes very fast. It was developed by Doug Schaff, who assumed that the currency trends accelerate and decelerate in cycles. Its algorithm was made public in 2008. Schaff Trend Cycle tries to combine two different methods of determining the trend direction changes — MACD and smoothed stochastic oscillator. The value of the indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. Two trigger levels are used — 25 and 75. Optional alerts are available. You can download this indicator for MT4, MT5

It is the classical version. In this MetaTrader version, you can modify the parameters of the basic indicators. You can use this Coppock indicator in MT4 and MT5.
