I present this expert advisor that catches the gaps, it is simple and it contains some comments. Tried in the strategy tester to find the results by yourself. I have tried it on most of the currencies and I have found it effective only on EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF and AUDNZD with profit and no losses at all.  
  
The program takes in to account the spread of the currencey into account in taking the profit. The program works or the idea the programs work one, is that the expert compares the open price of the new bar with the maximum or the minimum price of the previous bar, if there is a gap, directly it will send and order and a take profit.

This one seems good in strat tester. Getting nice profit, 78% win and 25.58 profit factor on [USDCAD](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/usdcad "USDCAD chart: technical analysis") 15M. We will see how it actually trades. Seems to take entries at market day changeovers. Where the biggest gaps are.

A kind of hedging style play base on "BaseSymbol" and hedge "Hedge.Symbol" to reduce the risk including the auto-calculate-correlation-function for all BaseSymbol-Hedge.Symbol.

Indicator Waddah\_Attar\_Explosion is very powerful. It alerts you to buy , sell , exit buy and exit sell.

This indicator shows ADX indicator in another easy way. Buy when Bars is Green, Sell When Bars is Red.
