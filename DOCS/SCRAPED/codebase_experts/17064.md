The Exp\_BykovTrend\_ReOpen trading system based on the signals of the [BykovTrend](/en/code/497) indicator with scaling up by the trend. The signal is formed when a bar is closing if a colored indicator arrow appears. Further, it scales the volume of the opened position if the profit points of the last deal in the position exceed the threshold specified in the EA input parameters.

Information on position scaling is stored in string comment to the trade in the format of: *number of scales / price of last deal / volume of last deal*.

Place BykovTrend.ex5 compiled file to the *<terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators*.

After compilation, the Exp\_BykovTrend\_ReOpen.ex5 expert file contains the BykovTrend.ex5 indicator as a [resource](/en/docs/runtime/resources), and therefore, it is not required to be present in the terminal folder for the compiled EA to work! For this purpose, the corresponding code has been added to the EA code in order to include this indicator in the expert's executable file.

The indicator executable file has been added as resources at the global scope

//---- Include the indicator in the EA code as resource  
#resource \\Indicators\\BykovTrend.ex5

Changed the string paths to the indicators used as resources in the block of the OnInit() function

//---- getting handle of the BykovTrend indicator  
 InpInd\_Handle=iCustom(Symbol(),InpInd\_Timeframe,"::Indicators\\BykovTrend",RISK,SSP);

Thus, the compiled executable file of the expert can be used on other trade terminals on its own without the indicators.

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

**Nikolay Kositsin:**  

As a matter of fact, I found the error in the TradeAlgorithms.mqh file. The problem is that in the terminal for some reason **0.09+0.01**  equals **0.099999. I fixed it in a rather moronic way (100\*0****.09+100\*0.01)/100 In the trailer is a new includnik.**

Thanks!!!

Hmm, I guess the crutches in the terminal continue, after the 45th refill already:

Well, geez, you guys have an appetite. I had to do something different. Now one tenth of the minimum lot step is added to the initial refill size. It will be cut off later anyway!

You've got a hell of an appetite. I had to do it differently. Now one tenth of the minimum lot step is added to the initial size of the refill. It'll be cut off later anyway!

"Boy, you have an appetite." :-) - I have to.

Thanks for your help !!!

Bem, droga, você tem apetite. Eu tivo que agir de forma diferente. Agora, um décimo da etapa mínima do lote é adicionado ao tamanho inicial da recarga. Ela será cortada depois!
