CCI "experiment" with a few things added that can completely modify the way CCI is calculated.

---

This version can be :

* adaptive (using VHF - vertical horizontal filter - for adapting)
* or
  "regular" CCI (no adapting).

Prices can be filtered - using one of the 4
basic average types :

* simple moving average
* exponential moving average
* smoothed moving average
* linear weighted moving average

or "raw" (when there is no price smoothing prior to cci calculation).

There is a choice of :

* floating levels
* quantile levels
* or no
  levels

 Coloring can be chosen :

* based on outer levels
* based on middle
  level
* or based on cci slope

Indicator is made multi time frame and with alerts (that are synchronized with colors change) already
