Graphic control for color selection.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/6/EURUSDH1__2.png)

The class uses the [IncGUI\_v4.mqh](/en/code/542)
 and [IncColors.mqh](/en/code/888) libraries.

IncGUI\_v4. mqh, IncColors.mqh and IncGUI\_ColorInput.mqh must be placed to terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Include

To use the class you need to include IncGUI\_ColorInput.mqh:

```mql5
#include <IncGUI_ColorInput.mqh>
```

Then, declare the class (CColorInput class instance):

```mql5
CColorInput ci;
```

To get the selected color, use the Color() method, the color can be set using SetColor(color aColor) method.

The example of the class use is attached - see eTestColorDialog.mq5.

The details can be found in the articles:

Great implementation!

The only thing is that clicking on the picker [control](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/310 "Article: Custom Graphic Controls Part 1. Creating a simple control") (which is "colour input") doesn't always work, because sometimes when you click on it, the button is involuntarily shifted.

Imho, for pickers it is better to catch mousedown event that occurs at CHARTEVENT\_MOUSE\_MOVE with sparam=1. For colourpickers on the web this is exactly how it is done.
