The idea of this indicator has been proposed by Bill Williams in his book ["New Trading Dimensions: How to Profit from Chaos in Stocks, Bonds and Commodities"](/go?link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Trading-Dimensions-Commodities-Marketplace/dp/0471295418/ "http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Trading-Dimensions-Commodities-Marketplace/dp/0471295418/").

It shows the "fourth dimension" of the market - it paints the bar charts with different colors (green, grey and red) depending on the current market momentum (1st derivative) and price acceleration (2nd derivative), which calculated by [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/awesome "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/awesome") (AO) и [Accelerator Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/ao "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/ao") (AC).

BW-ZoneTrade indicator

**Calculation:**

* if АС and АО are green, it means the green zone;
* if АС and АО are red, it means the red zone;
* if АС and АО have different colors, it means the grey zone.

In my opinion, this indicator is not quite well made. Let me explain why I have such an opinion. Firstly, when the indicator is connected to a chart with bars, it turns bars into candlesticks, overwriting the information of OHLC bars. The thickness is not adjustable. Secondly, besides green, red and grey zones, there is a concept of a "squat bar", which is coloured blue, regardless of which zone is currently occurring. Information about the "squat bar" is taken from the data of the [Market Facilitation Index (BW MFI)](/ru/code/36) indicator , which, unfortunately, is not flawless either.

It is a very good indicator. In line 12 you should correct #property indicator\_type1 DRAW\_COLOR\_CANDLES to #property indicator\_type1 DRAW\_COLOR\_BARS and everything will be fine. And on MFI it's already a completely different indicator, which probably doesn't exist yet. I am looking for it. Waiting.
