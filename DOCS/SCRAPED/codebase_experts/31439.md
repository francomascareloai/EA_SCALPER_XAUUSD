**Basics** :

> The Gann High Low Activator Indicator was described by Robert Krausz in a 1998 issue of Stocks & Commodities Magazine. It is a simple moving average SMA of the previous n period's highs or lows.
>
> There are quite a few versions of it, but it seems that we are missing an as-simple-as-it-gets version that would also be as efficient as possible for the sake of testing the performance of the indicator. This version does that - the only "set-back" is that the color of the line is changed based on the trend of the Gann high/low activator. The rest is as simple as it gets

**Recommendations:**

* Use the color changes as trend change signals
* At the time of this indicator invention, usual charts were (main hand drawn) daily charts. It is recommended that you start from daily charts testing and then build your way to other time frames (with some period experimenting advised)
