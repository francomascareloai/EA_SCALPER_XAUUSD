The Expert Advisor opens a deal during a breakthrough (on candlestick closure) of the trend line, drawn between the peak of the Zig Zag and the two latest peaks for the Buy orders. For the Sell orders — mirrored.

* Filtering by the МА. For Buy the price has to be higher than the МА, for Sell - lower than the МА.
* Closure by crossing the МА.
* Cyclicity filter. The breakthrough has to take place in the second half of the cycle from the first to the second vertex, overlaid on the first one to the right.
* Prohibition of trading on Friday after a specified time and closing the open deals, if their profit is less than set in the options.
* Breakeven and Trailing Stop.
