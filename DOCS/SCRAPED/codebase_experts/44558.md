This EA is a money management algorithm for opening and closing positions and uses martingale with a "multiplier".

1. Run EA before opening any positions to get the best result.
2. Run "MartingaleEA-5Levels" on any chart.
3. "Martingale Mode" should be true.
4. Put the name of symbols e.g. EURUSD or GBPUSD.
5. Choose a martingale multiplier and put it in "Martingale Volume Multiplier" to multiply a number to the previous volume. For example if you put 2 in this field, and the first position's volume is 1 lot. another position will open with 2 lots volume and third position  will open with 4 lots.
6. This EA can open max 5 martingale positions so put a number between 1 to 5 in the field of "Number Of Martingale Trading).
7. In distances field (distance 1 to distance5), you should put pips or points between each positions to open.
8. In the field of "Close all  positions when total take profit is" , put a number like 100, and when all martingale positions reach $100, all open positions will be closed.
9. In the field of "Close all positions when total stop loss is" , put a number like -500, and when all martingale positions reach -$500, all open positions will be closed.

Hello! I need some advice on how to run this Expert?

I tried to setup the EA as you mentioned on a [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"), but it does not run. Simulation run for 4 seconds but it does not provide any results. No buy or sell movement. Suggestions?

Using GBPUSD, account with $2800 (USD), trying to run on M15 using backdata from March 2022 until July 2023.

Hello,

This EA is a management strategy which means when you had a buy or sell position and your position is in loss, then this EA starts to open positions according to your personal setting that you can set in EA.

This EA does not start trading in back test or forward test.

This EA is written based on 2 functions and is open-source, you can just copy paste the codes in your own EA and change the money management system.

Hello good time  
Is this expert useful for the time frame of 1 or 5 minutes? Should it be done with the default settings or should we change it?

I want to modify the martingale as follows: 1\_ Instead of using a multipler that depends on (×) multiplication.. the addition (+) is adopted so that every subsequent deal has the contract added to it constant.. I think you know what I mean.. and this is to preserve capital.. without fear of  Opening many deals.

. 2\_ The [number of deals](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/trading/historydealstotal "MQL5 documentation: HistoryDealsTotal function") can be set at 50 or more.. There is no problem..especially in cent accounts.

3\_ Adding a software command that is not currently important..for those who like to activate it..and it is to combat martingale..several profitable deals are opened.  In the direction of the market as well.

. 4\_ Another software command is added to make a hedge between all the buying deals on the one hand.. and the selling deals on the other hand.. in order to eliminate any pending deals.. My dear, it is enough for you to help me in Item No. 1 to change the multiplication to an addendum  .. With an unlimited number of deals.. I will be very grateful to you.. If this is done, please send a copy to my next mail to try.

Hi  [ManiABLS](/en/users/maniabls),

what do you really think, is this EA is working only in MT4 or just in MT5?

Is there any function or detail you know, just specialised for MT5?

I do not know the diffenerences.

It would be nice to have your opinion before I triy it maybe in MT4.

Thanks.

[Equity and Balance as an indicator for MT5](/en/code/44136)

This is a very easy-to-use indicator that displays the changes in Equity and balance of the trading account as it dynamically moves.
Particularly useful on the back tester and good for beginners to read this very easy MQL5 code.

[Dynamic Trailing Stop Loss and Profit Target Management](/en/code/44099)

This code snippet implements a dynamic risk management strategy for existing trades. It focuses on closing trades based on profit or loss thresholds and employs a trailing stop loss to lock in profits as the trade moves favorably. The strategy helps manage risk and enhance profitability in a streamlined manner.
