That EA doesn't use any indicator, because it opens a sell and a buy trade at the same time, so it is a kind of hedging.

Both trades stopp loss at 99 pips and take profit at 100 pips, so the difference of 1 pip is profit.

**Works best on 1 min chart**

I would like to ask: which broker will allow such frequency of server messages and will not block the account due to hyperactivity? I have such
