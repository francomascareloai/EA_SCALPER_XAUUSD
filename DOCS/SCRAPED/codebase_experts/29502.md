This indicator is based on a code "MACD Mirror" published by the original author [andy tjatur](/en/users/pramono72 "andy tjatur (pramono72)").

### Following modifications have been made:

* Converted indicator code to strict mode;
* Added a drop-down list of 4 base indicators to choose from (MACD, RSI, CCI, and Stochastic);
* Added optional alerts, email and push notifications which can be enabled / disabled from indicator inputs;
* Indicator and output buffer titles change according to chosen base indicator.

### Screenshots:

![RSI](https://c.mql5.com/18/91/AUDUSDM15.png "RSI")

![Stochastic](https://c.mql5.com/18/91/EURGBPM15.png "Stochastic")

![CCI](https://c.mql5.com/18/91/EURUSDM151.png "CCI")

![MACD](https://c.mql5.com/18/91/GBPUSDM152.png "MACD")

### Recommendations:

* Employ other means of fundamental and technical analysis, do not rely solely on this indicator to make trading decisions.

Thank you for reading!
