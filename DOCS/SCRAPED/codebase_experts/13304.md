The script places the horizontal line on a chart and shows the trade volume in lots required to move the position to wherever the line is located.

Move the line, and the script will update the required lot size.

The thing is mega useful, but I think there is some glitch, attached a screenshot. 700 lots - it's hard to believe ... and why can't it be lowered below the [current price](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_property_double "MQL5 Documentation: Order Properties")? The value immediately shows 0 ...

For the current price of 1.11120 to move to 1.11221 you need to open buy 715 lots. You can try it on demo. If Lot shows 0, then no lot can move the position here.
