This code will basically write some value of prices in a file.

This is usually helpful when you want to create a local trade copier using file based approach.

It can also be used to save some values in a file temporarily and read it later across login sessions.

It can also be used to save custom logs in a file.

Don't try to use any price (or indicator) or server related functions in *OnInit* (or on load or in *OnTimer* before you've received a tick), as there may be no connection/chart yet:

1. Terminal starts.
2. Indicators/EAs are loaded. Static and globally declared variables are initialized. (Do not depend on a specific order.)
3. *OnInit* is called.
4. For indicators *OnCalculate* is called with any existing history.
5. Human may have to enter password, [connection to server](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/network/socketconnect "MQL5 documentation: SocketConnect function") begins.
6. New history is received, *OnCalculate* called again.
7. New tick is received, *OnCalculate*/*OnTick* is called. Now *TickValue*, *TimeCurrent*, account information and prices are valid.

Thank you for your feedback . Will make changes in the code base and publish updated version.

This code base is a simple function to check if current time lies within two specified times.

![Save current chart to default template](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/script.png)
[Save current chart to default template](/en/code/37669)

it saves the current chart to default template , it just helps to do it faster than a manual save. you can assign a hotkey for it.
it has no confirmation and immediately saves the template, if you want it to save to a template other than default just edit the code and replace "default.tpl" to any other name you want.
