An example of a multicurrency Expert Advisor that uses the loop, where each iteration is responsible for trading each symbol separately.

In order not to depend on ticks of any of the symbols, the [OnTimer](/en/docs/basis/function/events#ontimer) function is used for event generation.

Values of [Bollinger Bands](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/bb) are used for trading.

The EA trades according to the following strategy:

* Buy: the Ask price touches the bottom line of the Bollinger Bands calculated based on the low price.  
  Close: the Bid price touches the bottom line of the Bollinger Bands, calculated based on the high price.
* Sell: the Bid price touches the upper line of the Bollinger Bands, calculated based on the high price.  
  Close: the Ask price touches the upper line of the Bollinger Bands calculated based on the low price.
* Restrictions: only one deal can be conducted on one bar.

The presented code is only an example of how to create a multicurrency Expert Advisor. All the details of the program operation are described in the code.

This code is able to negotiate 3 pairs at the same time. Great!

Just a doubt: In which chart of 3 pair should I put the EA?

Thanks!
