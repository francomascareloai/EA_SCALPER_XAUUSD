Hello Friend.  
With activtrade M5 EURUSD warns that there is [error 130](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/errorswarnings/errorscompile "MQL5 documentation: No such structure member"). Why?

I installed this and it does not make any trades. My symbols have a suffix. I am trading a Demo ECN with a spead way under 10 on m5 EUR/USD. Maybe I should be more patient.

This is one of the important thing to consider in order to improve our strategy by calculating on average how much an asset moves, in which it will allow us to identify the best days to trade when the market moves the most as well as the worst days to trade in order to prevent trading during these days.
