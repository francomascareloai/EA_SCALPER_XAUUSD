The Trend Strength Index indicator measures strength of current trend. Basically it is similiar to a simplified auto regression indicator, because Correlation function calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two sets of data: the closing prices and the bar indices over a specified length. This coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the index of the bar and bar close price.

Interpretation:

* A value near 1 means strong uptrend with small deviation to the mean.
* A value near -1 means strong downtrend with small deviations to mean.
* A value near 0 means that there is possibly a flat.

The indicator is working fine.

The only fixing it needs is to make it refresh automatically.

I wonder if it from my side or the coding, the indicator new bars are not shown unless I change the TF.
