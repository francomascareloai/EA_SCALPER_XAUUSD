The trading system is based on the [PercentageCrossoverChannel\_System](/en/code/18195 "PercentageCrossoverChannel_System - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator signals. A signal is formed when a bar is closing, if a colored bar has occurred, while the previous bar had the opposite color or no color at all.

The Expert Advisor uses the compiled indicator file PercentageCrossoverChannel\_System.ex5 for operation. Save it to <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **during position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578 "TradeAlgorithms - Library for MetaTrader 5").

Default input parameters of the Expert Advisor were used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit were not used during testing.
