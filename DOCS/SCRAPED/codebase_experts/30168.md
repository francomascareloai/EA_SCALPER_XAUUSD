  The indicator is new version of previously published indicator showing relative actual strength of currency XXX.

  Zero line (0.0) presents average with chosen period (**AveragePeriod** variable).

  The indicator calculates its value of close prices of 7 pairs containing currency XXX.

  Colored histogram was added to simplify interpretation of the market situation.

  - TREND
  - COUNTER-TREND

  The same color on BASE and QUOTE in equal mode means higher oportunity to trade in correct direction.

  **Instance 1 = BUY:**

  **EUR USD.**

  You chose mode TREND for ***Power of EUR with average*** and for ***Power of USD with average.***

  Both indicators show **GREEN** color you should be prepared to **BUY** pair EUR USD.

  **Instance 1 = SELL:**

  **EUR USD.**

  You chose mode TREND for ***Power of EUR with average*** and for ***Power of USD with average.***

  Both indicators show **RED** color you should be prepared to **SELL** pair EUR USD.

Hi Jan

Thanks for all your hard work. Very impressive.

But I have a problem.

After downloading the mq4 file and putting in my indicators folder, all I get is a line chart. No histogram.

Do I need to do something different?

Just a newbie at this.

Thanks for your help.

Graeme

An oscillator that duplicates the chart of a selected asset in a separate window in three ways: line, bars and candles. This is essentially an indicator Bollinger bands, displayed in a separate window. In my opinion, it will be useful for beginners as a way to look at various technical signals from a different angle. This indicator helped me in an adviser for filtering unfavorable moments for trades.
