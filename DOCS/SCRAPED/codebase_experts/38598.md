Recursive Moving Average calls itself a number of times in order to reach the appropriate smoothing. For  instance DEMA and TEMA indicators are recursive exponential moving averages.  The goal is to remove the loop limit while still running fast. In addition a trigger line provides the trading signal.

Parameters define:

* regular period
* number of iterations: the higher the smoother
* smoothing method: exponential or smoothing only in order to keep it fast
* optional drawing of an arrow at signal

It sports two features\_

* the trigger line: it  equals average sum of smoothing iterations, the crossing of both lines signals a trade
* Optional drawing of arrow at signal.

As a rule of thumb, parameters should not overwhelm the chart with signals. This version handles open bar prices only.

Thanks for this interesting implementation... it gives a lot of posibilities for the optimization... to try to find the best "balance" of the "phase" and the "iterations" to get the trends at the rigth time...  
The only thing that I could suggest could be to change ghe name of "period" to "phase separtation" or "fast/slow period" or something like that (as period, in most indicators, its related of how many bars ago used for the calc)

Not sure if anyone need this.
