**Swing High/Low Identifier**

The **Swing High/Low Identifier**is a custom MetaTrader 5 (MT5) indicator designed to highlight significant swing points on your chart. This indicator identifies and marks swing highs and swing lows based on a configurable range of bars.

- ***Swing Highs*** are marked with red arrows above the respective candles.

- ***Swing Lows*** are marked with blue arrows below the respective candles.

This tool helps traders quickly spot important price levels and patterns, which can be crucial for making informed trading decisions.

**### Useful Strategies**

1. **Trend Reversal Identification:**

- Swing Highs can indicate potential resistance levels where a downtrend might begin.

- Swing Lows can signify potential support levels where an uptrend might start.

**2. Support and Resistance Analysis:**

- Use the marked swing highs and lows to draw horizontal lines or channels that can act as key support and resistance levels.

**3. Price Action Trading:**

- Combine the indicator with price action techniques, such as candlestick patterns or breakout strategies, to confirm entries and exits at swing points.

**4. Swing Trading:**

- Utilize the swing highs and lows to determine entry and exit points based on the observed price swings and potential reversal areas.

**5. Confirmation for Other Indicators:**

- Use the swing points as confirmation for other technical indicators, such as moving averages or oscillators, to enhance the reliability of trading signals.

This indicator provides a visual representation of key price points, helping traders enhance their technical analysis and decision-making processes.

Hi Philani, Just wondering if it is possible to add an Alert System to the code.   
Also, could you place the Arrows and "H" or "L" a little further away from the wicks of the Low and High of the candle.

Hello. Thnks so much for the swinghigh swinglow indicator. However,whenever there are 2 candles near each with either equal lows or equal highs,the indicator is not able to capture the swing low/high in that area.
