### Trading strategy

The EA uses a custom indicator '[RSI Dual Cloud](/en/code/39488)'. The EA uses four types of signals:  

* Entrance to the zone
* Being in the zone
* Leaving the zone
* Lines crossing

For 'BUY' signals, the zone is formed below the level '**RSI Fast and Slow: Level DOWN**', and for 'SELL' - '**RSI Fast and Slow: Level UP**'.

**Now more about the parameter groups**

***"Trading settings"***

> The Expert Advisor can be optimized by the '**Working timeframe**' parameter - the timeframe used for the '***bar #1 (on a new bar)***' mode. '**Stop Loss (SL)**' and '**Take Profit (TP)**' are in Points, to disable any of these options - set it to '0'. The modes for trailing and searching for signals ('**Trailing on ...**' and '**Search signals on ...**') can be of two types: '***bar #0 (at every tick)***' - work on every tick and '***bar #1 (on a new bar)***' - work only when a new bar is born. '**Maximum number of positions**' limits the maximum number of simultaneously open positions, and '**Minimum step of positions**' sets (in Points) the minimum distance between positions, it doesn't matter what type of position and relative position (higher or lower).

"***Signals***"

> Four types of signals from a custom indicator. Any signal can be enabled/disabled.

"***Trailing***"

> In the '***Trailing***' section, all three parameters are in Points. Trailing works ONLY for a profitable position! '**Trailing activate if profit is >=**' - this is an analog of breakeven, is set in Points. To disable trailing set the '**Trailing Stop**' parameter to '0'.

"**Position size management (lot calculation)**"

> The lot can be either permanent ('**Money management**' set to '***Constant lot***' and set the lot size to '**The value for "Money management"**') and dynamic - in percent risk per trade ('**Money management**' set to '**Risk in percent for a deal**' and set the risk percentage in '**The value for "Money management"**'). You can also set a constant lot equal to the minimum lot - '**Money management**' set to '***Lots Min***'.

"***Trade mode***"

> Restriction in which direction to trade. Can take the values '***Allowed only BUY positions***', '***Allowed only SELL positions***' and '***Allowed BUY and SELL positions***'

"**Time control**"

> This section sets the time range for searching for trading signals. The time range is enabled via '**Use time control**' and sets the time interval for searching for signals from '**Start Hour**'::'**Start Minute**' to '**End Hour**'::'**End Minute**'. The time range can be set both within the day and with the transition through the day. Does not affect trailing.

"**Additional features**"

> Flag '**Positions: Only one**' set to '***true***' allows the EA to have no more than one position in the market.
>
> WARNING: '**Positions: Only one**' set to '***true***' does not override '**Positions: Close opposite**' set to '***true***'! In other words: the opposite position(s) will be closed first
>
> ![Additional features](https://c.mql5.com/18/104/Additional_features__12.png "Additional features")

> The flag '**Positions: Reverse**' is responsible for signal reversal. An interesting flag '**Positions: Close opposite**' - when set to '***true***' before opening a position, it is guaranteed to remove opposite positions. '**Print log**' prints an extended log of all operations. The '**Freeze and StopsLevels Coefficient**' parameter sets the coefficient for stop and freeze levels for cases when these levels for a symbol are equal to zero. The recommended value is '3'.
