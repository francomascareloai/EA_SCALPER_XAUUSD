Hello,

While CCI signals can be taken or closed at any level.  The dynamic levels are given here to provide a way of avoiding false crossings of the zero 0.0 level.  This happened in the picture above on the 10th of May. Where the line crosses zero and then turns back.

The CCI of Moving Average is designed to avoid many such false signals, and a breakout of the dynamic levels can serve in this way.
