**Theory :**

Reasons for applying min/max normalization on RSI were explained here : [Normalized RSI](/en/code/23941) . This version is adding some options that can help using the indicator for trading decisions : multiple choice of color changes (on outer levels cross, on level 50 cross or on slope change) and some visual aids that can help see the current state of the RSI on a glance

**Usage :**

You can use color changes of the indicator as signals, or any other strategy based on RSI

Can you check if the indicator is coded correctly?  
inpHlPeriod is not used in the code.

It does not need to be used. Simply delete it from the code if it is making an issue to you(even though it should not)

The code is correctly calculating all that is needed to be calculated
