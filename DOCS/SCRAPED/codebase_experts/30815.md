The provided test script has included comments which are easy to follow along.

You can save the returned network configuration in a file then load it in different sessions.

This library has made little use of OOP, and should therefore be easy to follow along even by newer programmers.

Please share your comments and suggestions.

Happy trading.

I can't compile the script. Is there any missing file forgotten?

I can compile it. Did you create a directory with the name Nerve and placed the headerfile there?

```mql5
MQL5\Include\Nerve\NerveMatrix.mqh
```

Hi!

First of all, wonderfull job, but I was trying to change the prediction, in your sample, but, it doesn't change the result.

double predict[] = {1.0, 1.0};

but the result that I'm getting is 0,0093... but it should give me 1

Do you know if I'm missing something?

I only did this change in your sample:

double predict[] = {1.0, 1.0};

but the result that I'm getting is 0,0093... but it should give me 1

Do you know if I'm missing something?

Increase the epochs. That will get the value closer, but not equal to one, unless you use the appropriate output [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions"), like reLu or xor
