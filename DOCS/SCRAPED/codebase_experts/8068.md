It is realized by the Trading System on a release
from intraday time levels, which pay off on indicator Pivot.

    Trading:

* it is traded on hour timeframe;
* after 0 hours of current day, we count levels Pivot, Resist1, Resist2, Resist3, Support1, Support2, Support3;
* we make purchase after testing level Support (n) by hour
  candle (T-2) and closing of candle (T-1) above this level, and place
  stoploss on level Support(n1), takeprofit - on level Resist(n). Т -
  time of current hour;
* is used trailing for carry of a stoploss to a point of break-even;
* we make sale, on the contrary, when an hour candle (T-2) tests
  Resist(n) and the candle (T-1) is closed below the same level, and
  place stoploss on level Resist(n1), takeprofit - onSupport(n).

    I explain value of some entrance parameters:

* variable TgtProfit sets levels of stoplosses/takeprofits and can have values from 1 up to 5;
* if TgtProfit = 1, that a tested level (buy/sell) =
  Resist1/Support1, stoploss (byu/sell) = Resist2/Support2, takeprofit
  (buy/sell) = Suppor1/Resist1;
* if TgtProfit = 2, that a tested level (buy/sell) =
  Resist1/Support1, stoploss (buy/sell) = Resist2/Support2, takeprofit
  (buy/sell) = Support2/Resist2;
* if TgtProfit = 3, that a tested level (buy/sell) =
  Resist2/Support2, stoploss (buy/sell) = Resist3/Support3, takeprofit
  (buy/sell) = Support1/Resist1;
* if TgtProfit = 4, that a tested level (buy/sell) =
  Resist2/Support2, stoploss (buy/sell) = Resist3/Support3, takeprofit
  (buy/sell) = Support2/Resist2;
* if TgtProfi t= 5, that a tested level (buy/sell) =
  Resist2/Support2, stoploss (buy/sell) = Resist3/Support3, takeprofit
  (buy/sell) = Support3/Resist3;
* the variable isTradeDay defines, that as the open positions
  will be closed. If isTradeDay = true, the open warrants will be
  compulsorily closed on the termination of day, else warrants will be in
  the market yet will be closed on stoploss or takeprofit;
* at installation value of a variable isTrace = True in a broad
  gully the file is carried out record of the every possible debugging
  information for debugging the Trade Systems.

.  

    Results of testing: not all pairs at use of this
approach on a release send on a positive level of profitableness.
Basically positive profitableness has been reached at use trailing.

Thanks for comments.   
I answer your questions   
1. The expert only trades on settlement levels but does [not draw](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/indicatorconstants/drawstyles#enum_draw_type "MQL5 documentation: Drawing Styles") them,   
Presence of indicator Pivot is necessary for visual display of levels.   
2. The variable "isTrace" - does not influence on trade, and if it is
equal True-   
That occurs record of the various debugging information in a log-file   
Yours faithfully George.

Hi  
 great expert advisor!  
 please inform me about below questions:  
 1- I put the advisor on USD/CHF & [USD/JPY pairs](https://www.mql5.com/en/quotes/currencies/usdjpy "USDJPY chart: techical analysis") also, but noting happen. is
it working only on EUR & GBP & AUD pairs ?  
 2- Can I set the lots to my favorites? for example: 1 lot or 0.01 lot because it
takes the 0.1 lot for all trades.(even you set the lots variable as input)

Strong investor program persons gather.

 It was easy, but variously, you made them read an article of automatic buying and selling.  
Buying and selling by 各 and technical analysis becomes a lot from the middle of 2006.  
Just, it's technical, for, you couldn't earn any more.  
When automatic buying and selling was programed in the character until 2 years ago such as RSI and resistance operations of BORINJA, with not falling at all, the profit grew rapidly.  
A computer analysis of FX was that I participated in the foreign currency country of the world big, and I got up.  
Please see and study a list of automatic buying and selling which corresponds in order also to earn the future I have made and have developed.  
An article and the detailed statement with the detailed profit are mentioned.  
Certain analysis method which doesn't also fall from 2006 is needed.  
But, I also have to be able to win the analysis until 2006, it won't be also in common use from now on.

It's only a charge, but when not buying it, the information is free.  
It isn't sales advertisement.  
Because you can earn even if it isn't sold.  
This also establishes a home for everyone.
