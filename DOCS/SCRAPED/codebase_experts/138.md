There are suggestions for modifying your Expert Advisor:

1) make two MAs with period 85 at prices high and low, buy signal - when crossing high from bottom to top, sell signal - when crossing low from top to bottom.

2) filter signals by [MACD](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/macd "MetaTrader 5 Help: MACD Indicator") - crossing the zero line for 1-3 bars inclusive before and after crossing the MA

3) possibility of full manual adjustment of MA and MACD parameters; MACD filtering parameters (number of bars between MA crossover and MACD zero line crossover).

4) possibility to trade on ff from 5 minutes

5) trailing stop

Very good but i would add a [Momentum Indicator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/momentum "MetaTrader 5 Help: Momentum Indicator") to add on the buy/sell signals. But i am also using this ea on my signal.
