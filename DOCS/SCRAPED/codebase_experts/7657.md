Do you have any examples of good values to use?  So far I am seeing [zero results](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_initialization/matrix_zeros "MQL5 Documentation: function Zeros")...

HELLO [John Smith](/en/users/Scriptor "Scriptor") I LIKED A LOT OF YOUR EA, AND MAKE SEVERAL TESTS, WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO INVERT THE ORDERS?

SO THAT IN THE BAND MODO\_UPPER OPEN SELL AND MODO\_LOWER OPEN BUY.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TESTS I HAVE BELIEVED THAT WITH THAT CHANGE IT COULD INCREASE PERFORMANCE.

THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE!

THANK YOU !

RODRIGO

**RODRIGO\_BAURU:**

Please do not post using capital letters. It is considered to be shouting and is very rude.
