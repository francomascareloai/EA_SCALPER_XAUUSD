This indicator is ideal for scalpers who need to know the biggest spread possible with his broker. This will limit his stop-loss. Stop-loss should be higher than the biggest spread to minimize stop-hunt and slippage issues.

UPDATE:

Included lowest spread.

Good afternoon. The information does not stay on the screen very long. Am I doing something wrong?
