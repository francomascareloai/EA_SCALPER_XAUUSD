The EA uses two modes of martingale strategy:

Strategy 1

The EA enters trades according to the price that is above or below Moving Average. If we lose a trade then the EA will take a new trade in the opposite direction with a multiplied lot size.

Strategy 2

The EA enters trades according to the price that is above or below Moving Average. If we lose a trade then the EA will take a new trade with a multiplied lot size, according to the price that is above or below Moving Average regardless if the previous trade was buy or sell.

* This Martingale EA can work on all pairs and all timeframes.
* Best timeframe is daily.
* Start with 0.01 lot.

* Try it on demo first.
* This EA trades only with the price of open candle!
* If you do not want to trade with increasing lot size when you lose  a trade set:"IncreaseFactor=0"

I don't know why, but this doesn't work for me. It won't open a trade at all, regardless of the time frame. I use the stock settings just to see how it would work out of the box, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked at all. Is this no longer applicable?

1.try another platform

2.make sure you don't work with an ECN broker

3.see that you have money in the account

4.press"AoytoTrading" bottun on the MT4 platform.

Me encanta la idea de este ea. Pero por que comento que no se debe trabajar con un broker ecn?
