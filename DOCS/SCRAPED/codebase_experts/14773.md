You are on mobile, accessing something (an Expert) that only works on a desktop computer, so no wonder the link is not there.

Try from your computer and you will see it.

this is exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. I [checked](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/integration/python_metatrader5/mt5ordercalcmargin_py "MQL5 Documentation: order_calc_margin function") & tried everything to be sure. No luck. Please fix.

That is EA for MT5?  Where is it there?

![Example of Stochastic Automated](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Example of Stochastic Automated](/en/code/14864)

The main idea of this Expert Advisor is to trade by the basic concept of Stochastic oscillator in its basic parameters, with ability to change these parameters via the EA inputs.

![Not Only Spread](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Not Only Spread](/en/code/14315)

Spread, its moving average (EMA), its maximum and minimum, and ticks per second (market speed) in the Comment. The version 1.01 is made with the normal average, instead of the moving average.

[Predictor Marks for Renko, Mean Renko and Range Bars](/en/code/14868)

The indicator places two price marks for the expected candle close, based on the candle range and the chart type.

![Simple Multiple Timeframe Moving Average](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
