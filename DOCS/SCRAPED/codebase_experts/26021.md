I decided to take the original code submitted by raposter [here](/en/code/25452) and my own version 1.1 modification to the next level of modification. In this part i also going to add Average True Range calculated stop loss and take profit. Version 1.1 already been modified with better risk assessment,a dynamic position sizing system and now it's time to try it out with Average True Range based take profit and stop loss and upgrade to version 1.2.

You are right, but i'm referring to the actual expert that comment was posted in which is '[Awesome Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/awesome "MetaTrader 5 Help: Awesome Oscillator Indicator") Trader 2' and AwesomeV2 is something else

The EA uses a custom call to the indicator, so I can only guess that he has tried to use the EA but has not downloaded the indicator and placed it in the indicator folder.
