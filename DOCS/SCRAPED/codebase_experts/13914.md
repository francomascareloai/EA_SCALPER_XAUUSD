Hi

But you only risk this when company goes broke,  when you want to close all trades when in loss then you have to take a loss.

Or you can lose a part when your broker doesn't support the stock anymore.

This is the latest version i like to use.  
 Rijfie pyramid version 1.12.mq4  
  
Just one thing when using this ea then consider to close all open orders that are above 0 just before closing time.(This is because of gap opening next day)  
With version 1,10 it is possible to close the trades before closing time wich are above 0.(by using profit and set close all to true then set hour and minute)  
  
New version 1.12 percentage is changeble by setting steplevel1 set steplevel1 at 1 means 1%, 5 means 5%.

At the end you see some loses but that is because of ending testing.

Could you modify the EA for [Forex trading](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/mobile-trading "Mobile Trading Platform MetaTrader 5")? It would be very interesting to apply the principle

[Identify the potential best TIME To Trade (Improve your Strategy) - MT4](/en/code/31593)

For day traders, this is one of the important thing to consider in order to improve our strategy by calculating on average how much an asset moves, in which it will allow us to identify the best TIME during the day to trade when the market moves the most as well
