A form of trading system using Price Channel
principles has been implemented. Signals for opening a position are
received at the second bar after the price touches the upper or the
lower border of the channel. It must be traded for rebound, i.e., if
the upper border is touched, the Sell operation is performed, if the
lower one, the Buy is. The position is kept open until either stop
beats out or position is closed by the corresponding signal. Trailing
is used.

    When tested, some currencies did not give at
some timeframes any positive results at all (the only limiting factor
used was % of drawdown), so, there is something to think of: either
rules of entrance into and leaving of market must be improved, or
methods of channel trading must not be used for these currencies at
these timeframes at all.

They are warnings, not errors! Ideally they should be fixed, but it will still compile.
