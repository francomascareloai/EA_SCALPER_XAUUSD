This advisor utilizes the RSI indicator and performs adaptive search for minimums and maximums to determine optimal entry and exit points in the market. The advisor analyzes the last `BarsForCondition` candles to gauge the current market condition.

### Entry and Exit Strategy

Entry: The advisor opens a position based on signals from the RSI indicator.

* - Buy: if RSI reaches a minimum over the specified `BarsForCondition` bars.
* - Sell: if RSI reaches a maximum over the specified `BarsForCondition` bars.

Exit: Positions are closed upon reaching TakeProfit or StopLoss levels, which are set in points via the `TakeProfit` and `StopLoss` parameters.

### Signal Filtering

* Time: The advisor trades only within the time interval specified between `StartTime` and `EndTime`.
* News Avoidance: The advisor avoids trading during time periods specified in the `NewsTimeToAvoid` parameter.
* Spread: Maximum allowable spread values are set through the `MaxSpread` parameter.

### Additional Settings

Martingale: The advisor can employ a martingale strategy to increase the lot size during market reversals. This feature is activated by the `Upheaval` parameter and the `MartingaleMultiplier`.

Very cool EA, congratulations!

Would it be too much trouble to add daily profit and daily loss?

Set a financial target during the day (00:00-23:59), if it is reached, the EA stops operations and starts only the next day. Same for daily loss. It can be a safer way for those who want to use it on a real account.

Another thing I noticed is that the Martingale settings don't seem to be working. I put it as "false" and "true" and in the backtest I have the same result, even changing the factor.

I'm added new section with your suggest.  Martingale settings also fixed. 

---- Financial Settings ----  
DailyLossAndIncrease = false;
