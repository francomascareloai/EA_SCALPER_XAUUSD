Default Trailing Stop allow you to take a safe way to trade by ensure that if there is a reverse fluctuation you will be guaranteed profit.

But sometime you want Trailing Stop to take effect when you have a good amount of profit.

Because I you set Trailing Stop too soon. Spread may give you a loss rather than profit.

And you don't have time to wait for a good oppotunity to set Trailing Stop.

This is where Trailing Star come in.

Trailing Star will activate Trailing Stop only meet below condition:

> 1) If you set Price entry: Trailing Stop will start at that Price

> 2) If you set Point entry: Trailing Stop will start at that changed Point

The program is good

Suggestions for improvement:

1- Simple audio alert when it starts chasing profit

2- Adding a comment to the chart showing the variables entered by the user

Thank you

Hello and thank you for the Trailing Star. My problem is that the "point" program works perfectly on my MT5 DEMO platform but will not work on the MT5 LIVE platform. I have contacted my server "ThinkMarkets", and they are sure this is not being prevented by them as ALGO TRADING  has been activated for me to use EA's. They have suggested I contact you as you may be able to help me solve the problem and allow the Trailing Star Point to work on my laptop. I look forward to your assistance. Regards, Traill Adams. \*\*\*
