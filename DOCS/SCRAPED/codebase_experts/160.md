**Ramy Ram [#](/en/forum/1676#comment_673286):**  

Would someone be kind enough to add ([take profit](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders") and trailing stop ) to this EA.

And how do you get it to place the stoploss from the trade  price when you add trades?  The price moves but the ea places the stoploss at the ask or bid of the market price not the open trade price.

Thank you,

Ramy

Does not close trade, instead opens a trade in opposite direction

**GunnerNic [#](/en/forum/1676#comment_43636804):** Does not close trade, instead opens a trade in opposite direction

When this code was created, MT5 probably only supported "netting" accounts, so an opposite trade would close it.

However, now there is a the "hedging" account type, and so an opposite order is opened instead of closing.

So, the code will have to modified to allow closing the trade.

Thank you, that makes sense, can you recommend a one click quick close EA that works for fast scalping

Recommendations are against forum rules. You will have to do your own research.
