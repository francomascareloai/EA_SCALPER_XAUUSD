Famously, all these modifications of yours I used on MT4 - and your interpretation for mt5 they are also good.... by the way they all combine well with each other and not bad combinations are obtained... which cannot be said about Gadzila codes... somehow it became even more cheerful on MT5... see if the others will pull up and do something useful....
