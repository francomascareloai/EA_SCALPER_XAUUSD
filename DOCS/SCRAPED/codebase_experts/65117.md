**Bollinger Bands Squeeze - The Calm Before the Storm**

The Bollinger Bands Squeeze is one of the most powerful and sought-after signals when using the Bollinger Bands indicator. It signals a period of low market volatility that is about to end, foreshadowing a significant price move.

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/170/a1__3.jpg)](https://c.mql5.com/18/170/a1__2.jpg "https://c.mql5.com/18/170/a1__2.jpg")

**1. What are Bollinger Bands?**

* A technical analysis indicator consisting of three lines:

  + Middle Band: A 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA).
  + Upper Band: Middle Band + (2 x Standard Deviation).
  + Lower Band: Middle Band - (2 x Standard Deviation).
* The upper and lower bands expand and contract based on market volatility.

**2. When Does the "Squeeze" Happen?**

A Bollinger Bands Squeeze occurs when the upper and lower bands contract and move closer together. This indicates:

* The market is in a "consolidation" or quiet phase.
* Price volatility is extremely low.
* Buying and selling pressure is in equilibrium.

Visually, the bands coiling tightly resembles a squeeze, compressing the market's energy and tension.

**3. The Meaning: It Forecasts a Major Move**

"The tighter the squeeze, the bigger the move." When the bands begin to expand again after a squeeze, it is a clear signal that:

* The consolidation phase is over.
* A new, strong trend is about to begin.
* The price will "break out" of the trading range with high momentum.

**Crucial Note:**

* The Squeeze only warns of an imminent volatile move; it does not predict the direction.
* The breakout direction (up or down) must be confirmed using:

  + A sharp increase in trading volume.
  + Other technical signals (candlestick patterns, RSI, etc.).

**In summary, the Bollinger Bands Squeeze is an excellent tool for identifying when the market is "quiet before the storm." When you spot a squeeze, traders should prepare for a substantial price movement.**
