The double smoothed stochastic that is usually found is
using EMA (exponential moving average) for calculation. This version is a sort of deviation from
that. Default does use ema for calculation, but it allows you to chose
among the 4 types of averages for (double) smoothing.  That way we can get a completely new double smoothed stochastic types :

* SMA double smoothed stochastic
* EMA double smoothed stochastic(the default)
* SMMA double smoothed stochastic
* LWMA double smoothed stochastic

Any combination of prices usage (internally it orders the
prices so that they are "usable" in calculation). With all that, quite a
few new versions of double smoothed stochastic can be produced
(including a sort of a "raw stochastic" that can be produced when both
smoothing periods are set to <= 1)

---

Usually double smoothed stochastic is used as an over-bought and oversold type of indicator, but, with longer periods of stochastic calculations, it might be good to revise that point of view and check for reversal conditions too. Experimenting is advised in any case : as with any indicator, there is no universal setting that will fit all the symbols, so some adjustments are necessary

Possible usage examples :

---

Classical way of using it - William Blau was using levels 30 and 70, default settings for the indicator are a bit more aggressive 20 and 80. Levels, by all means, should be experimented with

And the "fooling around" mode : all the 4 types types (all the rest is the same, just the average types are different) combined in a single window, allowing to see something that could be called a "consensus" of 4 indicators

This example also reminds us that metatrader 5 have closed the gaps of graphical representation that existed before, and that a lot of surprisingly new ways of displaying what used to be just "as simple as it gets" display type can be achieved with the new display types now
