This particular expert advisor contains a very useful code which is often required by the developers. Most of the time , we need the last active trade. But in this EA you can search a trade with any index.

By active trade ,I mean market orders not pending orders

if you pass 0 then it will fetch the most recent active trade

If you pass 1 then it will fetch the trade before that and so on.

We can filter  the trades based on symbol and magic number.

Hello,

Can you make the code always take a specific position. Example: you have 8 open positions and always take the data on 2 open positions
