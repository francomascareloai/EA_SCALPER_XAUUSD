This is the Heiken Ashi indicator, based on the averaged Open, High, Low and Close prices, averaged using the [Adaptive Moving Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ama) (AMA).

The input parameters are the same as for AMA.

Quite possible... I didn't like it very much on adaptive, for some reason Open and Close overlap very unclearly somewhere.... =)

The idea is interesting, but t-x-b is right, only I will reinterpret - what do the colours show?

The first series of red lines is for selling, but then for some reason the second and subsequent times the red lines should show buying
