In an algorithm experiment, candlesticks were studied with a behavior of frog jump. It is considered a frog never jumps a single block of leaf in the pond but covers a distance from leaf 1 to leaf 3 or more.

This indicator hides alone candlesticks which are excluded in that experiment of frog hopping. if candle is bull and next candle is bear and its previous candle was also bear, it is considered an alone candlestick and its hidden on chart, vice versa for bear candle.

Right. In candle there is no fixed points so we are validating candles which are not alone based on idea that for a valid move candle should move 2 points or 2 candles in same direction otherwise it's considered noise.

It's good that you use both a before index and future index so it won't lag too much, only lag by one bar which is ok. In visual it's making swings easier to see. Some people say you can see market swings with the naked eye, but I never could do that easily

Further you can customize frog jump to hide 2 bar or 3 bar as well for next level research..

[Fair Value Gap](/en/code/48116)

Fair Value gaps are used in ICT's smart money concept where there is an imbalanace of 1 point or more between 1st candle's high and 3rd candle 's low in bullish and 1st candle 's low and 3rd candle's high in bearish

While manually adjusting the stop-loss of a single trade to match its open price is a relatively simple task, managing numerous positions individually can be cumbersome and time-intensive. The Titik Impas Breakeven script for MT4/MT5 streamlines this process, providing efficiency and convenience for traders dealing with multiple positions.

The EA only trades buy positions and does not use SL and TP.
