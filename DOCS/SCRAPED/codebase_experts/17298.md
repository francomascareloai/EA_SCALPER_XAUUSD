This indicator is almost same as the
"normal" MACD, except that its values are normalized and are roughly
falling into a predictable range of values (unlike the regular nacd,
that does not have that predictability of expected ranges).  That makes
it usable for direct value-to -value comparison over different
instruments and / or timeframes (since the values are comparable now).  

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/56/normalized_macd_cb.png)

Even
though the values are "very similar" to the original MACD, the values
can differ significantly — see the example: lower is the "regular"MACD , and, as it is obvious, it is quite different in some periods of
elevated volatility from the normalized version (not just regarding
values, but the slope as well as the signal values).

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/56/normalized_macd_cb_2.png)

It should be used using the same rules as regular MACD, but some experimenting is advised.

Hello, how could I insert arrows at each MACD cross?

Alex, if you are not in a hurry, I can do it for you when I find a gap today or tomorrow. Although what a weird [MACD](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/macd "MetaTrader 5 Help: MACD Indicator") you use

As you didn't explain much either, here is what I think you wanted. MACD Cross with Alarms, for MT4 and MT5.

I don't know how to write mql5 code, so it's automatically generated, compile it and try it for yourself.

I have used the normal MACD, included in the platform, I have not managed to find the advantage of the one you sent, in fact, although I know the author and I know he makes good indicators,

I think that in this case the original one is better.

I have made you to repin or not. Value 0 repaints, value 1, bar closed, does not repaint.
