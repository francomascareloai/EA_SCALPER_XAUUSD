### Description:

Just Enjoy it, it's very useful, Hamyar means "an assistant" in Persian.

Sorry for some mistakes in code, this is one of my first indicators i wrote in long time ago

it's useful to analysis the chart beside of your own system

Great!!

[My Line Order](/en/code/10464)

A simple way of managing orders and other features through horizontal lines.

Make big deal!

[ATR exponential](/en/code/10452)

Exponential average true range reduces the lag by applying more weight to recent prices.

["Build With Own Sketch" - LegoEA (or PanelOfSwitches)](/en/code/10458)

Perfect solution for newcomers at coding. Allows to implement strategies with difficult stop-management. Yes, this thing need some "baking", i.e. editing, but you will like the result; especially if the strategy is already tested with hands.
