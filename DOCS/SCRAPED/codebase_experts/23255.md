Trading signals are obtained based on the analysis of the following indicators: iMACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence, MACD), iOsMA (Moving Average of Oscillator, OsMA) and iForce (Force Index, FRC).

Search for results for the timeframes M1 to D1 for the default ES parameters:

unfortunately your breakout strategy doesn't work. If made of max. or minimum of the candlestick with an average of 21 only to confirm whether it is buy or sell. You are a good programmer, but few robots give you gain. You should spend more time optimising your strategies.

none of your breakout robots do any good. all loss
