This EA is in MQL5 language and is based on:

* SMA ([Simple Moving Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma)) with period 100 bar,
* ADX ([Average Directional Movement Index](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/admi)) period 14 bar,
* SAR ([Parabolic SAR](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/psar)) indicator.

I'm testing it now on period over 15 min in various crosses.

Interested in your EA... I am interested in the question, why you do not take into account the value of ADX itself, as an indicator for entering the market and for [closing a position](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal")?

It's only making 1 trade in all the passes in the optimizer. I even added inputs for the SAR settings, and the MA settings and timeframes. Still only ever makes a single trade. Is there a problem with this code?

Only orders will be opened, positions will not be closed

Fast FrAMA, in contrast to the version from MQL5 suite, has more wide applied price constant choose and, what's the main difference, calculation speed is increased by a factor of 30 to 100.
