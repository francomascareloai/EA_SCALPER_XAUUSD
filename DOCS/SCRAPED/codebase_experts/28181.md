Hi Dadali, thank you for the great EA, just wondering if the following options can be added.

1. open trades at the start of each candle

2. allow multiple trades to build up (currently it checks for open trades and won't open additional trades, I'd like to build them up, using the same comment/magic numers)

3. option to halt trading 30mins before and after midnight (the spreads are to big on H1 or less timeframes)
