Highest High fetch - Script.

1 File - Size : 1.62 KB.

The code defines a function "RangeHighs" that takes 4 integer inputs: pStartHour, pStartMins, pEndHour, and pEndMins, which represent the start and end time of a period.

It starts by initializing a "MqlDateTime" structure "time" and getting the current time using the "TimeCurrent" function. Then, it sets the seconds and hour/minute values of "time" to the input parameters.

The "StructToTime" function is then used to convert the "time" structure into a "datetime" type, which is stored in the "timeStart" and "timeEnd" variables. These variables represent the start and end time of the period of interest.

The code then declares an array "high" and sets it to be a series using the "ArraySetAsSeries" function. The "CopyHigh" function is then used to copy the highest prices of the symbol during the specified period into the "high" array.

Finally, the function returns the highest value in the "high" array, which is found using the "ArrayMaximum" function.

The "RangeHighs" function can be used in a MetaTrader 5 expert Advisor to calculate the highest price of a financial instrument during a specified time range and use it in trading logic, for example for entry or exit conditions.
