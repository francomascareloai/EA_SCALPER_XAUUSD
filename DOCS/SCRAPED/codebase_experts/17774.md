**Author of the idea** — [Sergey](/en/users/kordava "Sergey (Kordava)"), **author of the MQL5 code** — [barabashkakvn](/en/users/barabashkakvn).

The advantage of the Expert Advisor is that it can confidently move into positive direction. Its main disadvantage is the drawdown.

The idea is: trade EURUSD. The average price change for 90% of days is over 60 points. For one week, the volume exceeds 200 in 90% of cases.

It means that there is growth during the full three days of the week on the average. The weekly "turbulence" is minimal.

The strategy is as follows: stop loss is set at 60+10 points (in order to avoid accidental hitting, we add +10 points to the price), take profit is set at 190 (200 - 10 for the spread and the minimum distance to a trade).

Lot with a stop loss and take profit (70/190) is opened. Then the order is trailed by 10 pips every 10 pips (in case of reversal, it guarantees that the stop-order is aways positioned at the weekly bottom/peak price. As a result, an order will be closed during a week).

As a result, every 1.5 weeks theoretically make a profit equal to the average weekly volume (200).

‌

After optimization on EURUSD M5, from 2016.01.01 to 2017.03.02, initial deposit 10000 (the resulting parameters are already used in the EA):

It does not work at all - in the strategy tester there is a straight line, and errors are thrown about the impossibility to open an order because the market is closed.

The market cannot be closed all the time. Take a closer look, most likely there are some other errors in the MT5 Terminal Log. Perhaps the lot is too large. Try to start testing by setting the minimum lot 0.01.
