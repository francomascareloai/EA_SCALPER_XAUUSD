**Real author:**

This Expert Advisor is an object-oriented MQL5 version of the Trading Gurus MQL4 [random entry Expert Advisor](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://community.trading-gurus.com/threads/5-MQL4-Random-Entry-Systems "http://community.trading-gurus.com/threads/5-MQL4-Random-Entry-Systems").

This Expert Advisor is best used on the one minute timeframe. Try it on any and all currency pairs.

It uses a random number generator to simulate simply tossing a coin to decide on the direction of each trade. It stays in the market 100% of the time. It provides an example of a minimal Expert Advisor programmed in an [object-oriented style](/en/docs/basis/oop), based on a framework designed to facilitate the creation of more complex robots. It also provides a basis for quantifying the value added by alternative, more complex, methods of entry.

It can be surprisingly profitable!

**Input settings:**

* Magic - Magic number to make your broker think you have a profitable robot to hide! Default = 12345
* Slippage - Acceptable slippage on a market order. Default = 30
* ProfitTarget - Fixed profit target. Default = 1000
* StopLoss - Fixed stop-loss. Default = 3000
* Lots - Fixed trade size. Default = 0.1
* ReallyRandom - If true, then every backtest run should see a different sequence of simulated tosses of the coin. If false, every backtest run should see exactly the same sequence of simulated
  coin tosses. Default = true

The pip based settings should each be divided by 10 if your broker only quotes to 4 decimal places.
