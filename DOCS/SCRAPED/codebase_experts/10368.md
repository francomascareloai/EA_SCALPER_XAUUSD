I dont get anything like those results. The best I could get was Buy only and 90% from 2010 to now. DD was 19% according to MT4.

The main reason for the difference in results is that rustein has a full-pip account and many others have sub-pip

Also this should be another EA to use trading hours as a filter..

**With that done i get the curve below - revised code is** [here](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.selectfx.net/free_stuff_coop.htm)

Notes

- Not ECN/STP compatable

- LotSize calculation has bugs when run on small accounts

- TrailingStop code also has occasional errors

But... this is still a very good example EA

One bug in TrailingStop code was <placing stops too close to market>

This one fixed in version 101a in the download zip file

Ver 101a below with more risk

Uhhh, excuse me but this chart shows an 800% increase. Im not getting anything remotely close to that. Give up some parameters dude. Why the mystery?
