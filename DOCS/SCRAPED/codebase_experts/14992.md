Bollinger Bands as Support & Resistance Using Pending Orders:

* It will use the upper BB edge as Sell pending order & lower BB edge to place the Buy pending order.
* The central SMA line of the BB will be used to close the opened positions as enough.

It is not profitable, it is just an example for coding Forex robots.

It is trading only on time frame 15 minutes as you can see in the code below:

```mql5
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//|   expert OnTick function                                         |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void OnTick()
  {
   BB_UPPER   = iBands(NULL ,PERIOD_M15 ,BB_period ,BB_dev ,0 ,PRICE_CLOSE ,MODE_UPPER ,0);
   BB_SMA     = iBands(NULL ,PERIOD_M15 ,BB_period ,BB_dev ,0 ,PRICE_CLOSE ,MODE_SMA   ,0);
   BB_LOWER   = iBands(NULL ,PERIOD_M15 ,BB_period ,BB_dev ,0 ,PRICE_CLOSE ,MODE_LOWER ,0);
............
.
.
.
  }
```

You can change the period above from PERIOD\_M15 to PERIOD\_CURRENT or by using the ENUM\_TIMEFRAMES

Cos is in the code, I Copy the stdlib from MT4,

passes the compiler without fault.

BUT, is saved as MQ4 !

I forced save as MQ5, and lot of faults in the compiler.

In fact ... it is good fot MT4, NOT for MT5 !!!

My friend

It is only mt4

I think it is a mistake from the site admin to place it with mt5 section

Ok, sorry, as MT4 is a very interesting for amater coders like me, I only look for MT5 examples
