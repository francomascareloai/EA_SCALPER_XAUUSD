This utility copies deals from master to slave account. Accounts could be opened at different brokers. The utility translates all essential information between accounts using common file C4F.csv, placed in the common directory of MetaTrader 4. Reading/writing of a file is conducted by a timer.

Hello,

there is a major bug in the copier, which causes trades to close on the slave side. I was not able to fix it, but is has to do with the condition "opened\_list[0] == 0" which should not be true when there are still open trades on master side, but it is from time to time....

**derFux [#](/en/forum/67187/page4#comment_25825783):**  

Hello,

there is a major bug in the copier, which causes trades to close on the slave side. I was not able to fix it, but is has to do with the condition "opened\_list[0] == 0" which should not be true when there are still open trades on master side, but it is from time to time....

I analyzed the bug a little bit more.

It happens when the copier is used on a machine which is under heavy cpu/ram load or is not so powerful or running other EAs. For a very short time the copier file in the common folder is EMPTY and the slave than closes trades. Depending on how often and how long it happened after a while all open master trades are closed on slave.

I stopped analysing at this point and now use another copier without mql4 code. Maybe its a file access bug in mql4. While developing my own EA I had to implement some walkarounds for bugs in mql4 language/runtime.....
