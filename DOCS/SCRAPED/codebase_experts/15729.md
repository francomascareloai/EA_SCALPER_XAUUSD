This is not an indicator. This is the script. The main differences between indicators and the scripts are the following:

[Forum on trading, automated trading systems and testing trading strategies](/en/forum)

[What is the diference between an "Indicator" and a "Script"?](/en/forum/44600#comment_1536449)

[Forex Trader](/en/users/Forextrader), 2005.08.30 21:44

There is two major differences:  
 1) A [custom indicator](/en/articles/5 "Step on New Rails: Custom Indicators in MQL5") remains attached to a chart till its removed or the chart is closed; a script will detach from a chart as soon as its finished executing (of course, you could keep it executing in a loop).  
 2) An indicator's start() function gets called on every tick event for the chart; a script's start() function gets executed right after its init() function gets executed (not waiting for any tick event). (I hope I got this one correct.)

**Sergey Golubev:**

Thank you for the correction Sergey.

**richbois:**

richbois,

I wrote this script as a quick way to analyse the best timings to enter and exit 1-day-trades.  
  
I am considering writing it as an Indicator, in the future, so that it's fully attached to the chart, and usable in EAs as a visualization tool.

Cheers,  
Diogo Seca

Regular expressions provide a formal language for quick and flexible processing of texts. Each regular expression is a pattern (mask), for which the regular expression engine tries to find matches in the source text. A pattern consists of one or more character literals, operators, or constructs.
