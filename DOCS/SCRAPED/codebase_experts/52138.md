It doesn't work as you explained for the Buy/Sell conditions. If EMA 60 > 100 & 200 and RSI 10 is below 30, then the Buy signal should pop you and also, If EMA 60 < 100 & 200, and the RSI is above 70, then the [Sell signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/591 "Article: How to Become a Signal Provider for MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 ") should pop up. Check your code again, it does not meet the conditions properly,
