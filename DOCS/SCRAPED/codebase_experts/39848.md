### Description of the EA

A joke expert, now with a full range of features. There is Stop Loss, Take Profit, Trailing, lot size management, position reversal... Full description of the trading engine is in the " [RSI Dual Cloud EA](/en/code/39497) " code (only there is no indicator here).

Thanks for your concerns and providing interesting code

So how it will figured out signal buy/sell and if from any indicator or how

because a feature/parameter is provided to take signal either from current or next bar #1

The EA uses random numbers to take a buy or a sell positions.

Instead of adding SL tp for each order, you should add TP or total SL function to all orders, the [test results](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/TesterStatistics "MQL5 Documentation: TesterStatistics function") will be much better.
