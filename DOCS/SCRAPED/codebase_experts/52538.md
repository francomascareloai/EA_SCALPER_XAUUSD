Thanks for sharing.

The basic idea is that this tool shall not use much ressources, especially when attached to many charts.

Thank you for your guidance.  
 By the way, to avoid confusion, I added an on/off icon at the bottom center of the screen. I was wondering if you had a chance to review it—I’d really appreciate your professional feedback!

I’m planning to implement more updates in the future, and if you're okay with it, I’d love to share them with you again.  
 It truly means a lot to have tools like this available freely and generously, especially from someone like you. There aren't many people who offer such valuable resources to the trading community without expecting anything in return.

Professional traders can usually afford the tools they need, but for regular traders like me—who have worked hard for every single dollar—access to tools that make analysis and backtesting easier can really make a difference. So thank you again for making this possible.

Subject: Appreciation for Your Open-Source Crosshair Indicator

Dear [Soewono Effendi],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for sharing your Crosshair indicator as open-source code. It's been incredibly useful, and I truly appreciate your contribution to the MQL5 community.

I made a few modifications to enhance its functionality while keeping the core logic intact, including:

Added a dropdown menu for line width selection (1-5) for better user experience

Improved line style customization options

Implemented an on/off toggle button for easier visibility [control](/en/articles/310 "Article: Custom Graphic Controls Part 1. Creating a simple control")

I wanted to share these updates as a token of appreciation for your original work.

Thank you again for your excellent work! Looking forward to seeing more of your contributions in the future.

Best regards,

[sirous ghaffari- from iran]
