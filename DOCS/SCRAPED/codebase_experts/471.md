The main difference of this indicator from its [standard equivalent](/en/code/20) is the possibility to change the smoothing algorithm by selecting an appropriate one out of ten algorithms present:

1. [SMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - simple moving average;
2. [EMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - exponential moving average;
3. [SMMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - smoothed moving average;
4. [LWMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") - linear weighted moving average;
5. [JJMA](/en/code/427) - JMA adaptive average;
6. [JurX](/en/code/436) - ultralinear smoothing;
7. [ParMA](/en/code/433) - parabolic smoothing;
8. [T3](/en/code/424) - Tillson's multiple exponential smoothing;
9. [VIDYA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/vida "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/vida") - smoothing with the use of Tushar Chande's algorithm;
10. [AMA](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ama "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ama") - smoothing with the use of Perry Kaufman's algorithm.

It should be noted that Phase parameter has completely different meaning for different smoothing algorithms.

* For JMA it is an external Phase variable changing from -100 to +100.
* For T3 it is a smoothing ratio multiplied by 100 for better visualization;
* For VIDYA it is a CMO period, for AMA it is a slow EMA period;
* For AMA fast EMA period is a fixed value and is equal to 2 by default. The ratio of raising to the power is also equal to 2 for AMA.

The indicator uses SmoothAlgorithms.mqh library classes (must be copied to the **terminal\_data\_folder**\MQL5\Include). The use of the classes was thoroughly described in the article ["Averaging Price Series for Intermediate Calculations Without Using Additional Buffers"](/en/articles/180).

Good! In the attachment is the standard Chaikin. No new averages.
