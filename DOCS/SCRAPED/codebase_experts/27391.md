We Have A free EA base On an Idea here for you.

FIFO strategy

HOW it works:

When a candle move more than a special size (volatility in input parameter)
then we have a big/fast market movement for symbol price...   
so we use stop orders type to catch this big/fast movement. yes its easy
strategy and it has a big potential to be better.

When all the market movement makes you have lost, This ea makes a good profit with a little profit with many orders in a short time Just on a Candle.

When ex: M15 or better in H1 time frame a candle moves fast as I need it or have a good change in price about over the 200 points this is a good choice to
enter the market with a thiny order.

We make this Idea to an EA free.

if you have any question, any Idea to have better ea im here: [Fafolika](/en/users/fafoolika)

Enjoy

**Recommendations:**

* Use ECN account with smalest posible spread.
* H1 Timeframe / EURUSD and GBPUSD have best result.

version 1.1:

1. Work on strategy to have better result in real market.
2. Add input parameter to limit maximum orders taken in a candle

**See the result:**

if you have better idea to have better one leave me a message.

Remember, this program is an idea and needs to be
improved.  
Do not use this program on real market

**Edward Salas:**  
 This bot is horrible!  It
looks good on [Strategy
Tester](/en/articles/239 "Article \"The Fundamentals of Testing in MetaTrader 5\""), but when it comes to forward trading ... you die of a thousand cuts.  Even on a 1 point ecn spread, you make 1
trade, make 10 ... but 100 trades losing $10 each.  I tried 1 point, 3 point, 5 point, 10 point Trailis ... like the other guy says,
this bot is a waste of resources and time.  The creator can code, though, but the strategy sucks!

I say this in describtion too. Its nor a real EA that works in real market.

BUT I have this strategy that work GRATE on backtest and and I love that a person(programer) come here to talk and make this strategy better

You need to revisit your TrailingStop [function](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions").  Your current TS function gets your positions stopped out right away, especially when the
TS is too tight.  TrailingStops should be activated after the position turns positive.  Maybe add a BreakEven function to your
TS.  Let me know when you update your code so I can forward test it again.  Thanks.

If real world acted according to backtest, I would be millionaire in three months with 1000 USD and risking 40% of my account XD

But sadly, it is not the case. I was playing with your code and try to modify its trailing stop according to my logic (which might be flawed and really really crude, I never try writing any trailing method before) and currently under testing on my leftover [real account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"). I can not say anything about live testing now, but it seems to perform a little bit better. I'm not confident enough to release it, it was yours to begin with, but if you want I could email you the modified code.

I think this EA did best was entry with less risk, so it could be base entry for other strategy. I don't have good strategy and having less risky entry is a great help, so thank you..
