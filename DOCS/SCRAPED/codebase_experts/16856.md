**Real Author:** Khlystov Vladimir

The simplest Expert Advisor based on MFI. Sells at a downward crossing of an oscillator overbought level, buys at an upward crossing of an oscillator oversold level. The entry signal is formed when a bar is closing if the level is crossed.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at the following link: [Trade Algorithms](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.

dear programer expert EA....

I hope you can help me to edit this EA so that open transactions [based on Fractal](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/fractals "MetaTrader 5 Help: Fractals Indicator") close both for each transaction using SL and TP. so everytime there are standard fractals on TF 30 or other TF will do the transaction. Thank you for the help. I wish Vladimir always healthy and always successful. God bless you.

You write the second post - and the second time it is completely unclear what you want. Try this: Write a short sentence. Draw a picture.

thank you sir for responding to my chat. I just want to ask someone as a master coding expert mql5 to create a system like this. with reference to the fractals indicator. when there is a standard fractal arrow, then it will make a transaction either bbau or sell according to the fractal appears. and the close system for every open transaction is given a close option ALL and (options TP and SL for each open transaction).

Thank you for the help. God bless you.

I can recommend the [Fractals Corridor](/ru/code/28992) indicator - you can build an Expert Advisor based on this indicator.

I don't need indicators sir. I need a robot that works based on fractals only. every new fractal transaction starts with a reverse system or counter trend.
