My EA is based on JJN Scalper indicator. Real author of [JJN Scalper](/en/code/10814) is [Gordon Gekko](/en/users/ggekko1).

I made many changes to this indicator then made EA based on it. Now it seems to produce promising results.

Recommended timeframe: 1 hour. Recommended Currency: EURUSD.

All default setting are looking good as I set in this EA.

Following is a Strategy Tester screenshot of this EA:

**BradTogni:**  

Hi Hemant

How did you go over the weekend with the new settings? I've just started using this on a separate [demo account](/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"). i will let you know how it goes but i would also like to test your newer version also.

I need few days more, as i was busy in other works in this weekend. I am sorry for the same.
