Individual Strategy Insights**

When a single account hosts multiple strategies, the core challenge is separating the performance of each one. Without magic numbers, you’d have to rely on partial or ambiguous details like trade comments or ticket ranges. Magic numbers offer a systematic, numeric tag that an EA applies automatically.

**Accurate Performance Tracking**

You can quickly pinpoint which system has a drawdown or which one is performing exceptionally. This knowledge supports faster decision-making—e.g., deciding to pause an underperforming robot or allocate more capital to a winning strategy.

**Simpler Analysis & Logging**

Rather than combing through logs or the history tab, you have a concise, single “panel” that aggregates each EA’s total closed profit, deal counts, and relevant comment fields. This helps with record-keeping, strategy optimization, and even client reporting if you manage accounts for others.

### Usage Tips

- **Attach the Script/EA** to any chart in MT5. After compilation, it will immediately display a table with each magic number.
- **Check Chart Size**: If your chart window is very narrow, part of the text may extend off-screen to the right. Widen the chart or lower the font size for better readability.
- **Match Font**: Courier New is recommended for column alignment, but you can change it in the code if you prefer a different look.
- **Adjust Timings**: By default, the script updates every 5 seconds. Modify EventSetTimer(5) if you want more frequent or less frequent refreshes.

Good code. Here is a small improvement to display number of closed positions instead of total deals. The label in the table should be changed to "# Closed Pos"

```mql5
// Process closed deals
      for(int d = 0; d < totalDeals; d++) {
         ulong dt = HistoryDealGetTicket(d);

         long dEntry;
         HistoryDealGetInteger(dt,DEAL_ENTRY,dEntry);
         if(dEntry!=DEAL_ENTRY_OUT)continue;

         long dealMag = HistoryDealGetInteger(dt, DEAL_MAGIC);
         if((int)dealMag == mg) {
            dealCount++;
            closedPL += HistoryDealGetDouble(dt, DEAL_PROFIT)
                        + HistoryDealGetDouble(dt, DEAL_SWAP)
                        + HistoryDealGetDouble(dt, DEAL_COMMISSION);

            string dealComment = HistoryDealGetString(dt, DEAL_COMMENT);
            if(comment == "" && dealComment != "")
               comment = dealComment;

            if(symbol == "")
               symbol = HistoryDealGetString(dt, DEAL_SYMBOL);
         }
      }
```

It is a MQL5 full source Code. You need to compile it first in METAEDITOR and attach in chart.  
It will not trade. It will just show all the robots profits in screens using History Data and Magic Number.

![Download all ticks of a symbol's history](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Download all ticks of a symbol's history](/en/code/56324)

Download all the ticks from your broker for all the symbols in the market watch.
Download all history or until a specific date in the past if available.

[Useful #define statements](/en/code/56149)

These are some #define statements that are useful to perform operations in your EA. You only need to assign the name of your variables at the beginning of the file, and then let the other #define statements do the work.
In order to use this file, add #include <DEFINE\_statements.mqh> to the first line in your EA file.

[Telegram integration made easy](/en/code/56583)

The goal is to make the function readily available for any Telegram integration task in MQL5 development. By adding this file to your CodeBase, you can simply include it in your Expert Advisors and call the function directly from the included module. This eliminates the need to redevelop the code from scratch repeatedly, ensuring reusability across multiple projects.
