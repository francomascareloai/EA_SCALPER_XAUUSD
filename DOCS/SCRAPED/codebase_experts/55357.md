**BMA MetaTrader indicator** or Band Moving Average — was created by using the original moving average indicator and the idea from one of the site's visitors. The indicator displays itself in the form of three lines: the central one is the standard MT4/MT5 moving average (which can be simple, exponential or weighted), the upper line is the same as the central one but lifted up by 2% (by default), the lower line is the same as the central one but pushed down by 2%. Those two additional lines serve as the support and resistance levels. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

## Input parameters

* **MA\_Period** (default = 49) — the period of the standard moving average (central line).
* **MA\_Shift** (default = 0) — horizontal shift for all lines on the chart.
* **MA\_Method** (default = Simple) — the method for MA drawing.
* **Percentage** (default = 2) — number of percents to vertically shift the upper and lower bands compared to the central line.

The best way to use this indicator is to attach it to EUR/USD H4 chart (example shown above) and to sell when the price reaches upper band and to buy when the price reaches lower band. Moderate stop-loss level is advised in both cases as the price can sometimes break those levels or the lines may change directions suddenly.

Can it be used alone or required other indicator to work with?

![Beginner indicator MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Beginner indicator MT5](/en/code/55355)

Beginner MetaTrader indicator — a very simple custom indicator that displays the local tops and bottoms on the chart with the red and blue dots near them. It analyzes the maximum and minimums on the certain period and then compares them to the range, in which the currency pair was trading, and if the top/bottom is significant enough, it marks it with the dot. This indicator redraws itself and thus should not be used for generating trading signals as the dots' positions may change. Both MT4 and MT5 versions of the indicator are available.

BB MACD MetaTrader indicator — is a basic MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator variation, which helps in detecting the trend change points and measuring the current trend's strength. The indicator is drawn in the separate window on the chart and consists of two lines (blue and red) and the dots, which can be either green or magenta. The change of the dots' color is a good signal provider, while the width of gap between the two lines indicates the strength of the current trend. This indicator is available for MT4 and MT5.
