**Multi Moving Average - is an indicator which shows the information about 4 Moving Averages in a separate window.**

You can change the input parameters in the Indicator Properties window for any of the moving averages:

* Averaging Period (period).
* Averaging Method (ma\_method).
* The price type used for calculation (applied\_price).

and many options for text labels:

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/21/textdsettings.png)

It has been created to "unload" the price chart (especially of the Moving Averages), but save the useful information.

1. It shows the current state of the moving averages - rise or fall (using the different colors for boxes/arrow)

2. It show the currrent state of the moving averages relative to the price (or Moving Average with period 1) - is it above or below (using the different colors for text labels)

**So, configuring the Moving Averages periods, it is possible to understand the market trend without using the moving averages on the price chart!**

I'm aware that it's been a long time since publication and I have a lot of regrets. I'm trying to rewrite this indicator in mql5 and I'm having a lot of difficulties. Could you provide the mql5 version.
