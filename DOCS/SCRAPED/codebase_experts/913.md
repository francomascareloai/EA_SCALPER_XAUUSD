The Expert Advisor is based on [EMA\_RSI\_VA](/en/code/907) indicator.

Buy signal: upward crossover of the fast line, sell signal: downward crossover of the fast line.

The EA has lot increasing option, which depends on the deposit/max.drawdown ratio.

**Testing result (EURUSD, H1):**

Without lot increasing option, every tick, from 2009 (1\_eurusd\_h1.set)

![Without lot increasing option](https://c.mql5.com/18/6/1__1.png "Without lot increasing option")

With lot increasing option, every tick, from 2009. (2\_eurusd\_h1.set):

![Lot increasing option is enabled](https://c.mql5.com/18/6/2__1.png "Lot increasing option is enabled")

Testing with 1.000$ initial deposit and lot=0.1 (3\_eurusd\_h1):

![Testing with 1.000$ initial deposit and lot=0.1 (3_eurusd_h1):](https://c.mql5.com/18/6/3.png "Testing with 1.000$ initial deposit and lot=0.1 (3_eurusd_h1):")

When using of lot increasing option (use\_Multpl = true) it's recommended to test it without lot increasing. The resulted maximum drawdown can be set to Max\_drawdown input parameter

Result: $600 000 with $10 000 initial deposit with lot=1.0.

Hello,

your EA is very good but like any EA, optimization gives very good result.

Of that EA is used outside of a non-optimized time, EA has worse result.

Can you integrate a [continuous optimization](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/7290 "Article: Continuous Sliding Optimization (Part 1): Mechanism for Working with Optimization Reports ") in EA?

This will allow it to have an indicator to date compared to the market price.

Is it possible ?

Thank you for return

How is it that in the first set of parameters, all the Slow line parameters are smaller than the Fast line parameters?

Hi, I loaded indicator and the EA and compiled both of them. When I am [backtesting](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2612 "Article: Testing trading strategies on real ticks ") it, it is not triggering any trades? No error as well. Any idea what I might be missing? Thanks
