**Volatility Scanner**

in very raw form for number of currency pairs.

**Descritpion:**

Indicator shows volatility starting from actual candle on the right side (next to the symbol) to older candles left from actual.

There are 2 numbers for each candle.

Left number is body size/ average body size calculated of 100 previous candles.

Right number is high-low size/ average high-low size calculated of 100 previous candles.

Lower volatility is marked with color.

Blue color means that body size is **lower** than 50% of average body and at the same time the high-low size is  **bigger** than 50% of average high-low size.

Red color means that body size is **lower** than 50% of average body and at the same time the high-low size is **lower** than 50% of average high-low size.

You can change number of candles shown and size of the text.

**Usage:**

Can indicate uncertainty or possible swing points (doji bar) .

no.

red color means that **both** the **body** and the **hilo** of particular candle is under 50% of the average.

[blue color](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/webcolors "MQL5 documentation: Web Colors") means **only body** is under 50% of the average.

**JAN OPOCENSKY:**  

Hi Milton,

I suppose you are talking about CHFJPY pair at D1 (daily) timeframe.

5%/70% means that:

1. body of the candle at specific day was 5% of the average body (average calculated of last 100 candles) for the pair.

2. high-low of the candle at specific day was 70% of the average high-low (average of last 100 candles) for the pair.

Value 5%/70% indicates something like small "doji" candle.

This indicator gives you information about volatility or uncertainty more than strength.

Best regards.

Hi Jan

Thanks for the response.

I referred to  CHFJPY pair at D1 (daily) timeframe because that's your reference chart and the points were highlighted by the red rectangle.

In the same column:-

GBPCAD is 2%/38% - low Vol . . . . am i correct ??

EURCHF is 183%/129% - hi Vol  . . .  am i correct ??

Anything else to infer from the output?

Thnx & best regards

Hi,

yes. It is correct in general.

Maybe I would rather say "relatively lower" volatility and "relatively higher" volatility.

I choose border value 50% for coloring the volatility value.

But the value 50% is not strict.

I use the scanner to identify contraction fase.

If you see several (1, 2 or more) consecutive lower volatility values (red or blue) you can assume on contraction fase.

regards.
