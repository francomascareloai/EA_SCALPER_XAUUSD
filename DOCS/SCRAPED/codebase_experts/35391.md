This expert is very unpractical. It opens orders only when you previously set the price of the symbol in pips. Instead, it should be configured to open orders by distance from current price, in pips.

It was somewhat hard to find a good working example of DRAW\_COLOR\_CANDLES that was understandable, most of the comments were useless, and the documentation lacks to even specify the plot limitations (PLOT\_COLOR\_INDEXES being limited to 64 in length, [0; 63]) or which order the functions should be called.
