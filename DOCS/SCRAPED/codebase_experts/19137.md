A trading system based on the [Vortex](/en/code/19126 "Vortex - indicator for MetaTrader 5") indicator signals.

Note In order to provide conditions for the EA operation, you should add the [Vortex](/en/code/19126 "Vortex - indicator for MetaTrader 5") compiled indicator file to [data folder]\MQL5\\Indicators

A Note from the Author:

In the article "The Vortex Indicator" published in the January issue (2010) of the "Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities" magazine, the authors suggested a trading idea in the form of a reversible system with the following filter of entries: a buy or sell operation is only performed in case of a breakout of High/Low of bars, in which the intersection of Vortex was registered.

When VI+ crosses VI- upwards, it is a potential buy signal, but you should not enter the market until the price exceeds the High of the bar, on which the lines crossed. Likewise, when VI- crosses VI+ downwards, it is a potential sell signal, but you should not enter the market until the price falls below the Low of the bar, on which the lines crossed.
