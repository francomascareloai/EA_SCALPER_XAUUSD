This EA is made with an example of crossing MA as an entry signal.   
This EA was created for the purpose of learning MQL4 code.

Every order that is opened will use a different magicnumber according to each pair. You can see how this EA manages different magicnumber.

The **ManageOrders()** function will set the opening of new orders and averaging according to signal or without signal based only on the minimum distance between layers.

The **setTPSLMarti()** function can set TP for 1 position or multiple orders at the same TP price.

The **setTrailingStop()** function is used to set the trailing stop at 1 position of the initial order.

When you scalp manually, a simple EA could be an assistant to set StopLoss / TakeProfit for each trade you open.
