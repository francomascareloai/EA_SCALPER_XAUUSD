no mt4 script or ea will close all orders at once, mt4 can only cycle through the orders one at a time, unlike mt5 which utilises the multiple ocres to execute simultaneous commands

No, not even MT5 can do it all at once. What it does is use asynchronous mode to make it faster and seem like it is a bulk operation all at once.
