Trading system using the [ADXCrossing](/en/code/2160) indicator.

A trade decision is made when a colored indicator dot appears.

This Expert Advisor requires the compiled indicator file ADXCrossing.ex5 in order to run. Place it in <terminal\_data\_folder>\MQL5\Indicators.

Note that the TradeAlgorithms.mqh library file allows using Expert Advisors with brokers who offer **nonzero spread** and the option of setting Stop Loss and Take Profit **together with position opening**. You can download more variants of the library at [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/1578](/en/code/1578).

Default Expert Advisor's input parameters have been used during the tests shown below. Stop Loss and Take Profit have not been used during the tests.
