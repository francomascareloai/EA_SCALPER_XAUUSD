Hi man,

From your question I see that you've a newbie.

I highly recommend that you do not try any trading tool on real accounts.

This is the direct link to download the EA [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/download/32616/ea\_pub\_fibonaccipotentialentries.mq5](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/download/32616/ea_pub_fibonaccipotentialentries.mq5 "https://www.mql5.com/en/code/download/32616/ea_pub_fibonaccipotentialentries.mq5")

I highly recommend also that you watch my video tutorial about this EA.

[Free mt5 Copier](/en/code/32614)

Copy trading has become such a critical feature of forex trading. Some people see this as a potential business opportunity, while for opensource die-hards like me, we believe in giving back to the community rather than putting a price tag on everything 'nice'. So here it comes. A free opensource trade copier, which you are freely allowed to modify and distribute according to MIT license terms. It still has limited features, but the essentials like lot normalization are there. Please note that this copier only works for trading terminals installed on the same machine. Please share back any upgrades, enhancements or bug fixes to the discussion. Enjoy!
