### Description of the adviser

Working on the 'DeMarker' indicator using pending orders ('Limit' of 'Stop'). The signal is checked only when a new bar is born.

You can enable/disable '**Stop Loss**', '**Take Profit**', '**Trailing**'. The '**Trailing activate if profit is >=**' parameter has been added to Trailing - this is an analogue of breakeven: as soon as the position reaches the specified level (in Points), the classic Trailing is activated.

A pending order is placed at a distance of '**Pending: Indent**' from the current price. If the current spread is greater than the specified one ('**Pending: Maximum spread ('0' -> OFF)**' - the signal is removed and a pending order is not placed. All positions will be closed and all pending orders will be deleted if the target profit (in money) '**Target Profit, in money ('0' -> OFF)**' is reached.

If you have an error, you must take care of providing full technical information.

You must provide (if the EA is launched online and not in the tester)

> 1. Input parameters of the Expert Advisor (Screenshot of the '**Inputs**' tab) of the Expert Advisor

> 2. Two log files (log file from the '**Experts**' and '**Journal**' tabs).  ATTENTION : this must be a **\*.log** file, **not a picture**! ( [Platform Logs - For Advanced Users - Getting Started](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/start_advanced/journal "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/start_advanced/journal") )

> 3. Screenshot of the 'Trade' tab - ATTENTION: in the '**Profit**' column, you must select the item '**as Points**'! ATTENTION: be sure to show the '**Magic**' column!

An important clarification - trailing is included in the work ONLY for a profitable position. This is very important and fundamental.
