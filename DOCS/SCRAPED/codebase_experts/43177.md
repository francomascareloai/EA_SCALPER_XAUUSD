Hey guys! I copied and pasted in several ways and I couldn't. There are some step-by-step instructions, I liked the panel parameters, congratulations on making the code available, but I couldn't do it, it gave an error, I pasted it into int OnInit, at the beginning of the code, at the end of the code, anyway, you have to be a programmer to do it or a Does layman do it too? If you could explain a little more, I would appreciate it.

Thanks for the tip, Fernando. Now I posted it in English, I don't know if it came out, if it didn't, I'm sorry
