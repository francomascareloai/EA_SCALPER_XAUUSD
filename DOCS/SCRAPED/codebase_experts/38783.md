### The idea of the indicator

The indicator shows signals ('Arrow' objects) of the 'Moving Average' indicator crossings. The peculiarity of the indicator: if there was an intersection of 'MAs' (on bar #0), and then the intersection disappeared, the signal remains on the chart

The indicator can give sound signals of several types:

the reason i asked for the arrow to stick/stay, even when the ma jumps back over the other side is so that i can see what signals were false when i analyse my strategy in the future I will be able to see what signals were losers or were false.

The file didn't work on my Mt5. Is there any I can do to make it work?
