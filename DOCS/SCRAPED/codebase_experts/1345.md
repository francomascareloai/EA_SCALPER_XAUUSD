### Description:

Sometimes it is necessary to monitor several charts simultaneously to find correlations between changes in the rates of various currency pairs. This script allows traders to do that displaying several subcharts in a single chart window.

The script has been developed to create charts for the Championship's Minutes at the [Automated Trading Championship 2012](https://championship.mql5.com/2012/en).

Therefore, it includes:

* Drawing graphical objects in a single window (using [CChartObjectSubChart](/en/docs/standardlibrary/chart_object_classes/obj_controls/cchartobjectsubchart) standard class).
* Changing graphical objects display settings (background color, scale, grid, scrolling, etc.).
* Graphical object display area shift (using [ChartNavigate](/en/docs/chart_operations/chartnavigate) method, as well as [CHART\_FIXED\_MAX](/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chart_property) and [CHART\_FIXED\_MIN](/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_chart_property) properties).
* Drawing a rectangle on a graphical object ([OBJ\_RECTANGLE](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object) object).
* Drawing horizontal lines of the average open prices of short and long positions (using [OBJ\_HLINE](/en/docs/constants/objectconstants/enum_object)).
* Downloading data for the lines from the file (the text file with the data should be placed in **terminal\_data\_folder\MQL5\Files)**.

**CSubChartExtended** class derived from [CChartObjectSubChart](/en/docs/standardlibrary/chart_object_classes/obj_controls/cchartobjectsubchart) has been developed for drawing subcharts. It is derived from [CChartObject](/en/docs/standardlibrary/chart_object_classes/cchartobject) class - the basic class for working with graphical objects.

After examining and slightly changing the code, you will be able to enable displaying several currency pair charts in a single window in the way that is convenient to you.

**usen.usen.5:**  
 do you have any idea how to include some indicator in it? i do same things as in [https://www.mql5.com/en/code/359,](https://www.mql5.com/en/code/359, "https://www.mql5.com/en/code/359,") but the problem is, the indicator was not inside subchart but on mainchart. Thank you for your help and reply

As far as I know you can only do that with mql5 code.

Unfortunately I can not compile the code...

Anyone knows how to solve that issue?

This code is from 2012. A lot has changed in 10 years. You will need to revise the code so that it will work on the more modern MQL5.
