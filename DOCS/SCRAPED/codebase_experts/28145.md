**The background :**

> In “Reflex: A New Zero-Lag Indicator” in this issue, author John Ehlers introduces a new averaging indicator that he has designed with
> reducing lag in mind. According to the author, this new indicator can be used to generate signals in a more timely manner than other
> lagging calculations.

It is a sort of a momentum like indicator and should be used like that. Default set is rather long - as usual some experimenting with the
parameters should be done prior to using it in trading decisions

I'm studying your code to learn mq4 and mq5. I notice that in the original EasyLanguage we have:

```mql5
//Gently smooth the data in a SuperSmoother
a1 = expvalue(-1.414*3.14159 / (.5*Length));
b1 = 2*a1*Cosine(1.414*180 / (.5*Length));
```

But in your mq4 and mq5 versions you have:

```mql5
         double a1 = MathExp(-1.414*M_PI/m_period);
         double b1 = 2.0*a1*MathCos(1.414*M_PI/m_period);
```

Is there a reason why m\_period is not halved?
