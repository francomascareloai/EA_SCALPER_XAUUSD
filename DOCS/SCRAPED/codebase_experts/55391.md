**Keltner Channel (MetaTrader indicator)** — is a classical technical analysis indicator developed by Chester W. Keltner in 1960. The indicator is somewhat similar to the Bollinger Bands and Envelopes. It uses three plot lines: the middle line is the 10-day simple moving averag applied to the typical price ((high + low + close) / 3), the upper and the lower bands are produced by adding and subtracting the moving average of the daily price range (High and Low difference) from the middle line. This way, a volatility-based channel is built. In this version of the indicator you can modify all the parameters of the MA. The indicator is available both for MT4 and MT5 versions of the platform.

## Input parameters

* **MA\_Period** (default = 10) — the period of the moving average (middle line).
* **Mode\_MA** (default = MODE\_SMA) — the mode of the moving average (middle line).
* **Price\_Type** (default = PRICE\_TYPICAL) — the applied price of the moving average (middle line).

## Example and strategy

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Keltner_Channel__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Keltner_Channel.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Keltner_Channel.png") [![](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Keltner_Channel__3.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Keltner_Channel__2.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/158/Keltner_Channel__2.png")

The classical strategy with this indicator is to go long when the price closes above the upper band and to go short when it closes below the lower band. It seems to be a rather viable entry system. The exits can be based on three components: a very conservative stop-loss (as you see on the chart, false signals are not uncommon), some rather distant take-profit, and a cross with the middle line. Some traders also suggest using other indicators for confirmation.

Mathematically, the channel represents the bands weighted more heavily towards the upper side during uptrends and towards the lower side during the downtrends. This means that the upper line is less likely to be broken in an already established rising trend. The vice versa is true for an already established downtrend.

[Market Profile MT4](/en/code/55395)

Market Profile MetaTrader indicator — is a classic Market Profile implementation that can show the price density over time, outlining the most important price levels, value area, and control value of a given trading session. This indicator can be attached to timeframes between M1 and D1 and will show the Market Profile for daily, weekly, monthly, or even intraday sessions. Lower timeframes offer higher precision. Higher timeframes are recommended for better visibility. It is also possible to use a free-draw rectangle session to create a custom market profile on any timeframe. Six different color schemes are available to draw the profile's blocks. Drawing profiles as a plain color histogram is also possible. Alternatively, you may choose to color the profile based on bullish/bearish bars. This indicator is based on bare price action and does not use any standard indicators. It is available for MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5
