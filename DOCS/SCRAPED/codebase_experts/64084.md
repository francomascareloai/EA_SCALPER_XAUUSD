### WaveWeisBarForce - Accumulated wave volume (Weis)

**WaveWeisBarForce** is an indicator that applies the logic of volume waves (Weis) to identify accumulations and changes in market direction.  
 It adds up the volume while the trend remains unchanged. When the direction changes, it starts a new wave and resets the accumulation to zero.  
 Intensity is calculated by levels, according to the ratio between the volume of the current wave and the largest recent accumulation ( *Intensity* window).

---

### Input parameters

* **Volume\_type** - Defines the volume source (tick or real).
* **Intensity** - Bar window used for intensity reference.
* **Bullish Levels (1 to 4)** - Scale of green, from lightest to **LIME**.
* **Bearish Levels (1 to 4)** - Red scale, from lightest to **RED**.

*Example of the input parameters screen:*
