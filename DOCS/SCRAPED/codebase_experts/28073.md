A bit confused, while [checking](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") the code, I noticed you mention pips.

I would like to use it in points, so would I simply delete a zero?

hi

I have question:

in below inputs how much is minimum value?

```mql5
extern double TStart=10;//TS Start (pips)
extern double TStop=5;//TS (pips)
extern double TStep=5;//TS Step (pips)
```

minimum value for: TStart--TStop--Tstep

I have tested for below value but it didnt work

```mql5
extern double TStart=2.5;
extern double TStop=0.2;
extern double TStep=0.2;
```

I want for scalping

Best Regards

Neda

[Time Frame Changer](/en/code/28111)

I recently needed an indicator that, once placed in a window, is able to change the Time Frame of all open windows.
In addition, I wanted this indicator to be able to react to Metatrader's Time Frame selection bar.
Despite my various searches, I couldn't find anything suitable. So I decided to develop my own indicator.
I propose it to you here.
