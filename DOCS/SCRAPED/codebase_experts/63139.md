**PriceVar%** is an indicator designed to measure the **percentage difference between the price and a moving average**, highlighting the strength of the market movement in relation to a reference value.

[![](https://c.mql5.com/18/167/Captura_de_tela_2025-08-28_132529__1.png)](https://c.mql5.com/18/167/Captura_de_tela_2025-08-28_132529.png "https://c.mql5.com/18/167/Captura_de_tela_2025-08-28_132529.png")

### How it works

* If the **closing price is above the average**, the calculation is:

**Var = (High - MA) / MA \* 100**;

* If the **closing price is below the average**, the calculation is:

```mql5
Var = (Low - MA) / MA * 100;
```

The result is displayed as a **percentage histogram (%):**

* **Green** → when the price is above average (buying force).
* **Red** → when the price is below average (selling force).

### Interpretation

* **Positive** values indicate the distance of the **high from the average**.
* **Negative** values indicate the distance of the **low from the average**.
* The higher the absolute value, the greater the percentage distance of the price from the average.

### Practical applications

* Identifying **moments of overbought/oversold relative to the average**.
* Measuring **percentage volatility** around the average.
* Aid in **breakout or reversal** strategies by validating the intensity of the movement.
* Use as a **filter in automated systems** (e.g. only trade when the percentage change exceeds a certain threshold).

### Parameters

* **Average period (iPeriod):** defines the horizon of the moving average used as a reference.
