It is intended for demo and strategy testing only. The code requires significant updates before it is suitable for live trading. Consider it a work in progress and feel free to make improvements.**

Ideal For: EURUSD, GBPUSD, XAUUSD and other liquid pairs on M15-H1 timeframes. Requires medium-high volatility environments.  
  
Package Includes: Fully commented code, preset files for major pairs, and detailed risk management guide.

The EA identifies trade setups by waiting for a user-defined number of indicators (e.g., 2 out of 3) to show divergence simultaneously. This multi-layer confirmation approach filters out market noise.
Key Features:
Triple Confirmation Engine: Analyzes RSI, MACD, & Stochastic divergence.
Advanced Filters: Optional Trend Filter (MA) and Volume Filter for superior signal quality.
Full Customization: Control all indicator settings, divergence sensitivity, and trade logic.
Professional Risk Management: Use fixed lots or percentage-based money management with SL/TP.
