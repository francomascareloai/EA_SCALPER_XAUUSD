In a Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities article, May 2021, John Ehlers proposes a FM Demodulation Indicator that extracts the FM component of price movement.  The AM portion of price movement represents volatility and the FM component contains market timing information.  This indicator is an MQL4 implementation of the Easy Language indicator described by Ehlers in the TASC article.

Building good trading habits by seeing things in terms of percentage not in terms of money.

This EA, Ask you to Put price, whatever price you put, in "ZEN" field, you will get that price on all open orders either SL or TP value, that would help to close all orders at one price, and you can close all bulk orders in one shot. (works very well with large balance - i suggest cent / micro account for newbees. to be able to place large closure of orders. Openin random orders manually with ongoing trend is suitable for large order accounts.
