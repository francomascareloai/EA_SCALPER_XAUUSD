i am looking for this ea/indicator for mt5, anyone have it? thanks

![Squeeze RA V1](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Squeeze RA V1](/en/code/13938)

My version of Squeeze Indicator for MetaTrader 4. This indicator is based on a strategy mentioned in John Carter's book, Mastering the Trade. It is also a fully improvised version of Squeeze\_Break indicator by Des O'Regan.

![Robust EA Template](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Robust EA Template](/en/code/13942)

A robust EA template to use with your entry conditions.

![Trend_Catcher](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[Trend\_Catcher](/en/code/13661)

The EA looks for trend using three MAs (period 200, 50, 25 or other) and opens orders using the Parabolic SAR indicator. There is martingale in an Expert Advisor, the lot is calculated in percents from a deposit depending on Stop Loss.

![AutoSLTP](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/expert.png)
[AutoSLTP](/en/code/14005)

This EA will help you to set Stop Loss and Take Profit.
