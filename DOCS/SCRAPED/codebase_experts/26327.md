Hi Nikolaos,

Thanks for sharing this EA. It was almost what I was looking for, and I will make a donation from the first profit withdrawal :-D

I'm looking to restrict trading hours (e.g. instruct the EA to open trades only between 09:00 and 17:00). Do you have any suggestions on how the code lines should look like?

Hello,

give me little time to make a new version with [time filter](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/3395 "Article: Cross-Platform Trading Advisor: Time Filters ").

Edit: new version is up.

Hello,

Oh, that is great news!!

If you're working on a new version, I have two suggestions:

1. give the option to open a new order only after boths previous orders are closed (i did that, if CntBuy+CntSell==0 then open orders)

2. make it load by the saved settings at start-up, and not the default settings

Hello,

I am not working in new version. I 've make only a version to help you.

For first suggestion, the logic of expert need two orders to works.

For second suggestion, you can to use source code to change default [parameters](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/directx/dxinputset "MQL5 Documentation: DXInputSet function") as you want.

Best Regards.

To me, this is a 5 star EA, because it does exactly what it is supposed to do, the developer's support for a free EA is amazing and the profit (or
loss) is the job of the trader who sets it up.

Thank you for SailSystemEA, Nikolaos!

[Overlay Chart Modified to not repaint on each bar](/en/code/26289)

Used to compare 2 currencies on one chart, the Original indicator will recenter its calculation on every bar, and hence the price will keep shifting up and down and so the historical relative values do not remain constant. This indicator was modified so that the 'center' or initial relative reference point stays fixed and does not update each bar. It will only reinitialize when the indicator is reloaded or settings are changed.

Currency Index that calculates evenly on all 7 major pairs. Can also change base currency. Based on No Nonsense Forex podcast.
