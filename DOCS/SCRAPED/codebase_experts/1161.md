The Expert Advisor is rewritten from MQL4, the author is [klopka](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/klopka), link to the source [https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/8186](/ru/code/8186).

**How it works**

Three indicators such as [Moving Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma) (MA), [CCI](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/cci), [stochastic](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/so) are used.

When CCI is lower than a level, stochastic is lower than a level, price is higher than the МА, then there is a buy.

When CCI is higher than a level, stochastic is higher than a level, price is lower than the МА then there is a sell.

The image 1 shows the performance of the Expert Advisor in the strategy tester's visual mode, the image 2 shows the results of the tester.
