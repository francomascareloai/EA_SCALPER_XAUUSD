There are three Astro Indicators:

1. **PlanetCycles** Show the Angle (Aspect) between the two selected planets;
2. **Declination** Show the declination of all planets;
3. **BodyPosition** Show the Position of all planets.

Select the Flag geocentric in the Indicator Parameter panel. Otherwise the view is heliocentric.

All indicator values are in degree.

![Astro Indicators](https://c.mql5.com/18/30/astrodax.png "Astro Indicators")

**Special Astro Library required:**

A Special extern DLL 'swedll32.dll' for Astrocompution is required. Use it from the 'swedll32.zip' or download the original DLL from ftp://ftp.astro.com/pub/swisseph.

  

**Installation:**

1. Download all files;
2. Unpack the DLL 'swedll32.dll' in MQL5/Libraries from 'swedll32.zip' or get the original DLL (see above);
3. Compile the Indicators 'planetcycles.mq5', 'declination.mq5' and 'bodyposition.mq5'.

  

**Interpretation:**

You can analyse the Sun/Moon Cycle with the **PlanetCycles** Indicator.

Looking for turning Point in indicator and Price. the value 0 degree is the conjunction (new moon) and the value 180 degree is the Opposition (full moon).

For Inspiration search [https://www.google.de/#q=astro+based+trading+systems&start=0](/go?link=https://www.google.de/[hash]q%3dastro%2520based%2520trading%2520systems%26amp%3bstart%3d0 "https://www.google.de/#q=astro+based+trading+systems&amp;start=0")

  

**Use the Astro Indicators in Tradingsystems:**

The simplest way is the iCustom() Function. The other better way is an include of the 'swisseph.mqh' in your EA and use the Calculate() function.

Look in the indicator source how the function can be used. The return value a[0] is the bodyposition in degree and the returnvalue a[1] is the declination in degree. The return variable is defined as 'double a[6]' for more Body values.

Very nice! This actually needed the 64bit version of SWEDLL, which can be downloaded from https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/sweph.zip. Plotting takes some time because it must load the dll and compute values.

 Very nice! This actually needed the 64bit version of SWEDLL, which can be downloaded from [https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/sweph.zip.](/go?link=https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/sweph.zip. "https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/sweph.zip.") Plotting takes some time because it must load the dll and compute values.

The files have now moved to Github. [https://github.com/aloistr/swisseph/tree/master/windows](/go?link=https://github.com/aloistr/swisseph/tree/master/windows "https://github.com/aloistr/swisseph/tree/master/windows")

I changed the dll to 64 bit and was getting some plots on the indicators
