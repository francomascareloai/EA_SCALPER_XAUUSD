the zeroprice its market price! it not pips!

  

You can only make

  

zeroprice = zeroprice + 20\*Point; // it ZeroLevel +20 pips

  

or

  

zeroprice = zeroprice - 20\*Point; // it ZeroLevel - 20 pips

What would be usefull would be making the comments in english so that people who doesn't read russian could understand what's goin on in alerts. To modify and understand comments are sometime usefull for coders too.
