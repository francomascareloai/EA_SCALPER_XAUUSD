I have attached 3 scripts that will help you to modify the price, the Stop Loss and Take Profit of a pending order.

Once you have added a pending order to your chart with a SL and a TP use the following scripts:

* DROP\_MOVE\_PENDING\_PRICE.mq4 : If you want to move the price of your pending order you just need to select this script, point the mouse in the place you want to move your new price level and drop.
* DROP\_MOVE\_PENDING\_SL.mq4 : If you want to move the Stop Loss of your pending order you just need to select this script, point the mouse in the place you want to move your new SL level and drop.
* DROP\_MOVE\_PENDING\_TP.mq4 : If you want to move the Take Profit of your pending order you just need to select this script, point the mouse in the place you want to move your new TP level and drop.

Very nice job with your scripts I down loaded them all and am trying them out now. I was looking for something like this for a long time. I have a question. I scale in to trades and would like to adjust tp and sl on these charts that have two or three entries on them. Is there an adjustment that can be made to the script to work in these instances? Right now no changes are made on a chart with multiple entries. Very nice work I am glad I found your scripts today. ; )

Hi, Blackhawk

I`m using your scripts `
DROP\_MOVE\_PENDING\_TP`  and `DROP\_MOVE\_PENDING\_SL`  since about 3-4 months ago. After the
MetaTrader platform  was updated this
week with build 625, I just can`t used your scripts anymore. In fact, it
happened this: when I launch the script nothing happened on the screen or to my
orders, but when I tried to re-open the same script or to open another one, i`m
asked if I want to close / or not the script already opened.

I have not programming knowledge, but I tried
to do this: I erased the old script and download it again from
codebase.mql4.com, I download another MetaTrader 4 from another broker and
[import](https://www.mql5.com/en/economic-calendar/united-states/imports "US Economic Calendar: Imports") your script again, I always restart the the platform or even the pc, I recompiled
in metaeditor – always nothing new happened. And in the `journal` I have not
error messages.

So, please, can you help me somehow.

Thanking you in anticipation!
