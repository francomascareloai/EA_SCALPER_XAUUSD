Pivot point indicator with an addition of 4 ways of calculating pivot points :

* (Previous High +Previous Low + Previous Close)/3
* (Previous High +Previous Low + Previous Close + Previous Close)/4
* (Previous High +Previous Low + Previous Close + Open)/4
* (Previous High +Previous Low + Open + Open)/4

Added "alternate way" of calculating pivot support and resistance lines - I found that in a lot of versions the R3 and S3 are calculated differently than the original (it effectively makes it "tighter" than the original) so I decided to enable that way too.

Hi, can you implement that the Weekend Data can be excluded. In Forex the trading time begins [on Sunday](/en/docs/constants/environment_state/marketinfoconstants#enum_day_of_week "MQL5 documentation: Symbol properties") 11:00 PM and then the pivot points are incorrect for the Monday. Thanks a lot.
