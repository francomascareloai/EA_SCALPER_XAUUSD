This indicator promote new way of analyses signals from standard indicator named RSI.

Main feature of RSI is level crossing signals. Usually 30 and 70.

But it's bad relative to real market state. That's why i added dynamic levels for this indicator.

By this way, signals efficiency become more powerful

**Shahabeddin Baset [#](/en/forum/466452#comment_53238412):**  

A very good job. Thanks.

Are you using [standard deviation](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/sd "MetaTrader 5 Help: Standard Deviation Indicator") for finding these dynamic levels?

thank you.  
No, just EMA with shift

Hi Andrei,

Great job. Would you be able to convert this code to Tradingview by any chance?

I know nothing of code but I believe that your code has great potential.
