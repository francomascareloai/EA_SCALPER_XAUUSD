The script does not stay on the chart and has to be loaded after each trade has completed. Is this how it is supposed to work? if not can you fix it because it looks like a good tool

Cheers D

An oscillator that duplicates the chart of a selected asset in a separate window in three ways: line, bars and candles. This is essentially an indicator Bollinger bands, displayed in a separate window. In my opinion, it will be useful for beginners as a way to look at various technical signals from a different angle. This indicator helped me in an adviser for filtering unfavorable moments for trades.
