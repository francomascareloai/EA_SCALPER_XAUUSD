Fair Value gaps are used in ICT's smart money concept where there is an imbalanace of 1 point or more between 1st candle's high and 3rd candle 's low in bullish and 1st candle 's low and 3rd candle's high in bearish

You can customize the colors of FVG from indicator settings

Dear Dominik your idea to convert it to buffer version is interesting but the attached indicator by you still draws rectangles, a real buffer version may be possible using DRAW\_FILLING

While manually adjusting the stop-loss of a single trade to match its open price is a relatively simple task, managing numerous positions individually can be cumbersome and time-intensive. The Titik Impas Breakeven script for MT4/MT5 streamlines this process, providing efficiency and convenience for traders dealing with multiple positions.
