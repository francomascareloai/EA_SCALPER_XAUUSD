The script exports **all** the symbols available in the Market Watch window into a csv file ("**MT4\experts\files\SymbolList(ServerName).csv**").

  
  

The symbols are searched for by a blunt (I'm tempted to say) enumeration of letters. I.e., we take the AAAAAA symbol and check whether it is available in Market Watch. Then we take AAAAAB, and so on. The method is very slow, I couldn't invent anything wiser.

The script extracts the list of symbols from the \*.set file and saves it as the csv file.
