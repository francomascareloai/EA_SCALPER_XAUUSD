**RSIOMA MetaTrader indicator** — this indicator takes two moving averages, calculates their RSI (Relative Strength Index) and then also adds a moving average of the calculated RSI. These two lines now can accurately signal the trend changes. They are shown in the separate window where they change from 0 to 100. The auxiliary histogram is shown for a quick-glance view of the current trend. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5 versions of the MetaTrader platform.

## Input parameters

* **RSIOMA Period** (default = 14) — the period of the RSI and the moving averages that are used to calculate the RSI. Increase it for smoothness, decrease it for signal frequency.
* **RSIOMA Mode** (default = MODE\_EMA) — the mode of the moving averages used for RSI.
* **RSIOMA Price** (default = PRICE\_CLOSE) — the price levels used to calculate moving averages that are used in the RSI.
* **MA of RSIOMA Period** (default = 21) — the period of the moving average of the RSI.
* **MA of RSIOMA Mode** (default = MODE\_EMA) — the mode of the moving average of the RSI.
* **BuyTrigger** (default = 20) — a trigger level for the oversold situation.
* **SellTrigger** (default = 80) — a trigger level for the overbought situation.
* **BuyTriggerColor** (default = clrMagenta) — an oversold line color.
* **SellTriggerColor** (default = clrDodgerBlue) — an overbought line color.
* **MainTrendLong** (default = 50) — if RSIOMA is above this level, then the trend is considered to be bullish.
* **MainTrendShort** (default = 50) — if RSIOMA is below this level, then the trend is considered to be bearish.
* **MainTrendLongColor** (default = clrRed) — a bullish trend separator color.
* **MainTrendShortColor** (default = clrGreen) — a bearish trend separator color.
* **MainAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an alert will be issued when RSIOMA crosses the overbought level from above or the oversold level from below.
* **AuxiliaryAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an alert will be issued when the histogram signals an imminent trend reversal.
* **EnableNativeAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, a native MetaTrader popup alert will be used for any of the above two conditions.
* **EnableEmailAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent on an alert condition. Email should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Email*.
* **EnablePushAlerts** (default = false) — if *true*, an email message will be sent on an alert condition. Notifications should be properly configured in MetaTrader via *Tools->Options->Notifications*.
* **TriggerCandle** (default = Previous) — the candle to issue alerts on: *Previous* — the most recently closed candle or *Current* — the yet unfinished candle.

[Recent High/Low Alert MT5](/en/code/55504)

By default, the maximum band is displayed with a blue line; the minimum band is displayed with a yellow line. Additionally, it can invoke a popup alert, send an email alert, or issue a notification alert when the current price (Bid) breaks recent High or Low level. All alerts can be turned off. If you use the email alert feature, do not forget to set the email settings in your MetaTrader platform's options window. Same with push-notifications.

![Schaff Trend Cycle MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Schaff Trend Cycle MT5](/en/code/55511)

Schaff Trend Cycle (MetaTrader indicator) — is a cyclical oscillator created by calculating the stochastic over stochastic over a MACD line using cycles. The result is the improved version of the oscillator that is not choppy during the trends and reacts to the changes very fast. It was developed by Doug Schaff, who assumed that the currency trends accelerate and decelerate in cycles. Its algorithm was made public in 2008. Schaff Trend Cycle tries to combine two different methods of determining the trend direction changes — MACD and smoothed stochastic oscillator. The value of the indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. Two trigger levels are used — 25 and 75. Optional alerts are available. You can download this indicator for MT4, MT5

![Spread indicator MT5](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Spread indicator MT5](/en/code/55513)

Spread MetaTrader indicator — displays current spread in the main window of the chart. You can modify the font parameters, indicator's position and the normalization of the spread value. The spread is redrawn after each tick, ensuring the most current and active spread value. This can be useful for brokers with variable spreads or with spreads that are widened often. You can also enable a spread label to be shown near the current Bid line. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.
