Wick Ratio Candlesticks are recognized by its upper and lower wick ratio instead of open and close properties.

By default a snow candle appear when upper wick = lower wick

If upper wick > lower wick, it plots a bear candle

if upper wick < lower wick, it plots a bull candle

Colors can be customized from indicator settings.

"This advisor uses the RSI indicator to determine optimal entry and exit points in the market. A unique feature of the advisor is its martingale strategy, which allows for position reversal with an increased lot size during market reversals. The advisor offers flexible trading time settings: you can set a working time range and disable trading during specific hours to filter out news events."
