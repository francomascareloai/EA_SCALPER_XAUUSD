Before using the script set the necessary value of "max bars in history" at MT4 Tools -> Options -> Charts. This particular number of bars will be uploaded and controlled. Then restart MT4 and use the script. The end of script working doesn't mean the end of history uploading. You can view the process of history uploading using the task manager. You should restart MT4 for history to be saved in \*.hst files when the process of uploading is over.

====

The script is very particular about the amount of RAM:

-if you have 1 GB of RAM then during the process of history uploading from server of DC Moneyrain with the parameter "Max bars in history" equal to 50000 you will be able to upload only currency pairs and metals;

-then you should unload MT4 with the control of unloading at the task manager to form the \*.hst files;

-then you should start MT4 and continue the uploading with the next group.
