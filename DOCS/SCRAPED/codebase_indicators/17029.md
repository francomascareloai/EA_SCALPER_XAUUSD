Aroon oscillator is usually not associated with to much flexibility. It is its nature.

---

This version is breaking that. Instead of using fixed levels to find out trends / overbought / oversold conditions, this version is introducing dynamic levels in order to change that rigidness. Levels are calculated using quantile bands (some more information on quantile calculation can be found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile")) and that changes the way how Aroon oscillator behaves significantly.

Entries (and exists) are signaled much faster and, with some parameters experimenting, it can be fine tuned to work in a ways that Aroon oscillator never could be used.

---

Indicator can use any price combination(s) for calculation (original Aroon oscillator could use only high an low), is multi time frame and already has all the usual alerts built in

Even though the default calculating periods of Aroon oscillator are usually set to 25 (as described here :

Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down measure the number of periods since price recorded an x-day high or low. Aroon Up is based on time and price highs. Aroon Down is based on time and price lows. For example, 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high, while 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. These indicators are shown in percentage terms and fluctuate between 0 and 100. The Aroon Oscillator is simply Aroon-Up less Aroon-Down. The default parameter in SharpCharts is 25 and the example below is based on the 25-day Aroon Oscillator.

longer periods of calculations can be very useful when switching the usage of Aroon oscillator from a kind of momentum indicator to a kind of trending indicator. An example of 50 period Aroon oscillator is probably self explanatory - and with the dynamic levels, it becomes even more obvious how it can become a "trending" indicator instead of "search for reversals" default mode of operation :

how to get [buy/sell signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/522 "Article: MetaTrader 5 Added Trading Signals - Better Than PAMM Accounts! "), where is that described and other details about oscillator.

it would be helpful if somebody explains that
