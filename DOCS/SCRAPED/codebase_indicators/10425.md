Just a simple script, that reads the HTML file a report, or detailed report, and draws a transaction from it on the chart, in standard form.

Orders arrows will be drawn for the current tool. If the report contains trade on multiple instruments, you have to switch the chart itself.

Trading instruments, which was trading will be printed out as a tip.

External variables - name of the file, and mode erase its own graphics.

The report file is first necessary to put in the \ terminal \ experts \ files \

I managed to get this to work, by replacing;

  with

if(sy!=StringUpper(StringTrimLeft(StringTrimRight(Symbol()))))

1. ArraySize(); was returning the size of the whole data array vs the 0/row elements which was causing the for loop to fail
2. Wrapping Symbol() with StringUpper(StringTrimLeft(StringTrimRight())) normalised the comparison which meant that there was a like for like comparison, else no symbol was being matched for me
