**DEFINITION :**

Before we start, it is important to define the **Martingale system**. It is a system that allow you to increase the size of your position as the trade moves against you or after a losing trade. \*

**INTRODUCTION :**

This strategy is the well known set & forget accompanied by the martingale system. It is very useful if you are very busy in which you don't have time, you want to trade the London session while you are sleeping in USA, etc.

Do not forget to send you comments as well as rate this script. Happy trading! 

**HOW TO USE IT :**

You can check the following video that will explain

* The set and forget strategy (with the martingale system)
* Who usually use this strategy,
* How to compile the script, and
* How to use it in real example

**PARAMETERS :**

This EA has 5 inputs

* 1st input (NB TRADE): Specify the total number of Stop limit (Buy/Sell limit).
* 2nd input (INITIAL ENTRY): Specify the initial entry price.
* 3rd input (INITIAL STOP): Specify the initial stop loss.

Hi,

I tried to use this code, but when I want to run it is set that is a problem with the settings. I [check](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") what could be the problem and I can not understand. Did you come trough this already? or have any idea on what should be the problem? 

Many Thanks,

Dumitru

Hey Mario, thank you for the script. Have compiled and tested both.

I have used the Anti Martingale script which works fine.

The Martingale on MT4 does not seem to work.

No matter what the parameters are it only takes out a [max of two](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/math/mathmax "MQL5 documentation: MathMax function") trades.

Are you able to check this to see why?

Thanks in advance - Dean.

**NAZMTAZ:**  

So that it can trade with other Eas on the same a/c & also to identify each currency prs. from each Ea for trade analysis. All Eas now have magic #s either as an input or encoded.

Thanks.

[@NAZMTAZ](/en/users/nazmtaz) This EA does not have a magic number, but it could get a update to include the magic number

[@Dumitru010](/en/users/dumitru010) the script will place

* BUY trades from bottom to top, and not from top to bottom, while
* SELL trade from top to bottom, and not from bottom to top.
