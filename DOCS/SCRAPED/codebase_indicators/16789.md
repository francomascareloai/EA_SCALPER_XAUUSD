This indicator shows vertical and horizontal lines that you
can set in very different ways. For example in my picture there are
entry levels (dash yellow lines) and TP (solid lime lines), but you can
easily change all distance of all lines and find the best way to work
with it.

Then there are vertical lines on the most hot hours, but you can easily change on settings.
