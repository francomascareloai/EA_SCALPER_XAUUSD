Also, it can do some other things:

* Slope
* Slope in degrees
* Variance
* Std Deviation
* Mean
* "Fake Graphs"

With this function (fake graphs) you can plot the actual data from a indicator. This is valuable when you are coding an EA and testing it on MT4, as the strategy tester does not show in real-time the actual graph from the indicators... Just fill the array with the actual N-values and call the procedure "Fake Graph" to plot it rigth on the main window
