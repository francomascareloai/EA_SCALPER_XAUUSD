Indicator SCAD (iCrossAD). It shows possible reversals or price roll-backs. The indicator is based on the intersecting by A/D a trend line built on the extreme values of indicator A/D.

The indicator is based on the "MT4 signal function based on the Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator" described in article "[An Insight into Accumulation/Distribution and Where It Can Get You](/en/articles/1357). Briefly: If a trend line built on the A/D indicator chart is crossed by the indicator line, then the price will most probably cross the trend line based on the price chart, too. Thus, upon a signal from the indicator, a reversal or a roll-back can be expected.

The indicator has twenty-three adjustable parameters:

* **AD applied volume** — volume used when calculating AD
* **Bars for calculate** — number of bars where the intersection is looked for.
* **Unchecked bars** — number of the last bars on the right, the intersection with which is not considered as a signal ("sensitivity" filter).
* **Filtering indicator** — filtering indicator

+ **Without filtration** - without filtering on additional indicators
+ **Filter by CCI** - filter on indicator CCI

* **Use setting by default CCI parameters** — if CCI is used for filtering the signals, then the Yes value allows using the CCI default settings.
* ****CCI p**eriod** — CCI calculation period if default CCI settings are not used.
* ****CCI a**ppled Price** — CCI calculation price if default CCI settings are not used.
* **The upper level of the filter indicator** — upper level of the filtering indicator.
* **The lower level of the filter indicator** — lower level of the filtering indicator.
* **Draws arrow on chart** — draw signal arrows on the price chart (Yes/No).
* **The size of the arrows on the chart** — size of signal arrows on the price chart.
* **Bullish arrows color** — color of bullish arrows.
* **Bearish arrows color** — color of bearish arrows.
* **Draw a trend line** — draw a trend line on the A/D indicator chart, intersections with which are searched for (Yes/No).
* **Trend line thickness** — thickness of the trend line.
* **Trend line style** — style of the trend line.
* **Downtrend line color** — color of the downtrend line.
* **Uptrend line color** — color of the uptrend line.
* **Draw the search area** — draw the area for searching the intersections (Yes/No).
* **Search area style** — drawing style of the search area

+ **Fill** - filling
+ **Frame** - frame

* **Search area line width (if Frame mode)** — line width of the search area (if drawing with a frame is selected).
* **Search area line style (if Frame mode)** — line style of the search area (if drawing with a frame is selected).
* **Search area color** — color of the search area line/filling.

**Vitaly Muzichenko:**  

So we can't know it's the very top/bottom, and the indicators don't know that either.

"If an asset is expensive today, it may be even more expensive tomorrow.

So the notion of "don't sell/top not buy" - will only be confirmed after time.

Well that's for sure, but... There are levels that can still give some information about support/resistance. We know that these levels exist. We do not know if they will be broken, but we can assume a rebound. And this is an additional filter - it is better not to take potential profit than to take real losses.

Yes, but filters are for later, and now it is arrows, and nothing more

Logic, it is a regular grid on the arrows of the indicator, that is, on each arrow make entries, no step. There is a signal - build a net, closing on a common trawl, that is, trawl the entire net, but separate buy and sell. If there is only one position in the market and there is no network, we trawl only one position. In general, everything is the old-fashioned way, but further modification to resist the trend.

Good evening Artyom, please tell me which lines of the [code published](https://forge.mql5.io/help/en/guide "MQL5 Algo Forge: Cloud Workspace for Algorithmic Trading Development") by you are responsible for building the SCAD chart in the subwindow under the main chart. And how and what exactly should be changed so that this subwindow is not reflected. ???

```mql5
#property indicator_separate_window
```

You don't need to run the indicator for it not to be displayed ;)

It is an indicator in the subwindow. And launching it, you should understand that the subwindow will be built by the terminal. You can just change its size to the minimum size with your mouse.
