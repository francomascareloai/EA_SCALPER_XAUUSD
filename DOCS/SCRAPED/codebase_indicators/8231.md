It was said in the ["How to Evaluate the Expert Testing Results"](/en/articles/1403) article, that "It is easy to recalculate the profit in points then". The represented script calculates in points the profit and all parameters calculated from it. The script creates two files: the summary report and the list of performed trades that can be impotred in the electrincal table.
