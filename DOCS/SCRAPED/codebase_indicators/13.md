Bill Williams's [Awesome Oscillator](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/awesome "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/bw_indicators/awesome") (AO) is a 34-period simple moving average, plotted through the middle points of the bars (H+L)/2, which is subtracted from the 5-period simple moving average, built across the central points of the bars (H+L)/2.

It shows us quite clearly what’s happening to the market driving force at the present moment. [(B. Williams: "New Trading Dimensions: How to Profit from Chaos in Stocks, Bonds and Commodities"](/go?link=https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Trading-Dimensions-Commodities-Marketplace/dp/0471295418/ "http://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Trading-Dimensions-Commodities-Marketplace/dp/0471295418/")).

**Signals to Buy**:

"Saucer" is the only signal to buy that comes when the bar chart is higher than the zero line. One must bear in mind:

* the saucer signal is generated when the bar chart reversed its direction from the downward to upward. The second column is lower than the first one and is colored red. The third column is higher than the second and is colored green;
* for the saucer signal to be generated the bar chart should have at least three columns.

Keep in mind, that all Awesome Oscillator columns should be over the zero line for the saucer signal to be used.

"Zero line crossing" is the signal to buy generated when the bar chart passes from the area of negative values to that of positive. It comes when the bar chart crosses the zero line. As regards this signal:

* for this signal to be generated, only two columns are necessary;
* the first column is to be below the zero line, the second one is to cross it (transition from a negative value to a positive one);
* simultaneous generation of signals to buy and to sell is impossible.

"Two pikes" is the only signal to buy that can be generated when the bar chart values are below the zero line. As regards this signal, please, bear in mind:

* the signal is generated, when you have a pike pointing down (the lowest minimum) which is below the zero line and is followed by another down-pointing pike which is somewhat higher (a negative figure with a lesser absolute value, which is therefore closer to the zero line), than the previous down-looking pike;
* the bar chart is to be below the zero line between the two pikes. If the bar chart crosses the zero line in the section between the pikes, the signal to buy doesn’t function. However, a different signal to buy will be generated — zero line crossing;
* each new pike of the bar chart is to be higher (a negative number of a lesser absolute value that is closer to the zero line) than the previous pike;
* if an additional higher pike is formed (that is closer to the zero line) and the bar chart has not crossed the zero line, an additional signal to buy will be generated.

**Signals to Sell:**

Awesome Oscillator signals to sell are identical to the signals to buy. The saucer signal is reversed and is below zero. zero line crossing is on the decrease - the first column of it is over the zero, the second one is under it. The two pikes signal is higher than the zero line and is reversed too.

Awesome Oscillator Indicator

**Calculation:**

AO is a 34-period simple moving average, plotted through the central points of the bars (H+L)/2, and subtracted from the 5-period simple moving average, graphed across the central points of the bars (H+L)/2.

MEDIAN PRICE = (HIGH + LOW) / 2   
AO = SMA (MEDIAN PRICE, 5) - SMA (MEDIAN PRICE, 34)

where:

* MEDIAN PRICE - median price;
* HIGH - the highest price of the bar;
* LOW - the lowest price of the bar;
* SMA - [Simple Moving Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma").

Here is an example of the first and second wave the other day. You can reverse the second wave into sub-waves of smaller TFs and look for upward momentum after reaching the target level. See Figure 2.

Having an ordinary AO indicator, even without seeing the chart you can know what to do buy or sell, let's look at the histogram of the indicator. Here is the markup.

Having ordinary AO indicator, even without seeing the graph, you can know what to do to buy or sell, look at the histogram display. That markup.

I found the Awsome Oscillator referenced in documentation for how-to-code indicators in several locations, but didn't think the code example provided as easily identifiable [functions](/en/docs/constants/namedconstants/compilemacros "MQL5 documentation: Predefined Macrosubstitutions") for creating an indicator as might be optimal. I made this re-write to provide a more structured coding example - perhaps it will help others who are new to coding in MLQ5 and -- maybe readers will comment and provide their own ideas to make it into a really good example.  Optimally, the examples distributed with the terminal would be the best-of-the-best examples of code style and function.

I haven't seen an actual style guide for mql5 programs, like the one here: [https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.&nbsp](/go?link=https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.  "https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.&nbsp"); I notice a number of preferences in the coding styles of some of the best developers on the site that are different from that guide, and some that are different from my personal preferences, like  
- The curly braces follow the more compressed style resulting in fewer coding lines, and with the brace directly below the first character - such as directly below the f in a for loop.  This is good if that is the style, but personally I think it increases the time it takes for the human eye to find the beginning and end of the code blocks.  
- member variable names are preceded with m\_ where the above guide has them with a trailing underscore.  I like the m\_ better.  
- enumerations are named in the macro naming style versus with a leading k - visually, I prefer the macro naming style, but think technically, the leading k as in the github doc is better.

I added a variable last\_prev\_calculated to the AO example to keep track of the last fully successful run, and used that as the return value instead of the zero which I think will result in an unnecessary a full start-over - is that a good code practice?

Is there a forum discussion for style that I just haven't found yet?

I see several years of consolidation in the 4th wave. I bought for a hike in the 5th wave of LTC.

Average True Range Technical Indicator (ATR) is an indicator that shows volatility of the market.

![Accumulation Swing Index (ASI)](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Accumulation Swing Index (ASI)](/en/code/11)

ASI was created by Wales Wilder as an ordinary fluctuations indicator that gets signals from previous maximums and minimums of price.

Sometimes this is useful - to observe the behavior of the oscillator in the channel. Greatly simplifies the evaluation of the situation.

![Accumulation/Distribution](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Accumulation/Distribution](/en/code/6)

The Accumulation/Distribution Indicator is determined by the changes in price and volume.
