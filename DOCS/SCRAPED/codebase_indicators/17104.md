One more "experiment" using the CCI.

---

This indicator can calculate CCI of CCI of CCI of CCI ... up to "level" 25.

When
level 1 (one) is used, it is the same as "regular" CCI. After that, CCI of CCI
is calculated and so on (each new step uses previous step cci value
instead of the price - it is calculating CCI of CCI instead of CCI of
price). Levels are limited to 25 purely for practical reasons (the CCI
becomes in-recognizable after some level, but it can easily be extended
in the code to calculate CCI to any (reasonable) level.

The rest of the usual
stuff is already included :

* floating levels
* or quantile levels.

Price
smoothing/filtering - including the price smoothing methods. Coloring
choices and alerts. Multi time frame ...

PS: higher levels of CCI recursion should be used with care. The recursive method is highly experimental and should be used as such - do not use it based on a first impression but please do the testing part thoroughly before any usage.
