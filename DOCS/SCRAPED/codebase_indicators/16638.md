This is an improved Jurik Filter with the option to be applied to any indicator not only to prices.

The computation in this version is improved compared to orginal version (faster response but the smoothness is kept).

Also, the addition of slope coloring can help in many cases: even in cases like setting the period to 1 and masking the underlying indicator with color changes even when the underlying indicator can not do that.

Hi Mladen,

Many thanks for the superb work you put into the indicators you develop.  We are all fortunate for the effort you put in.  I have been looking at the jurik\_filter indicator that i intend on integrating into an EA i am working on.

Now i am certain this is nothing wrong with the indicator itself and might be a setting or configuration applied to MQ5 but i have noticed that on longer periods such as 500 to a 1000 the indicator tested in the Strategy tester does not correspond to values as displayed in the chart.  I am certain there is a good explanation and something i can do to get it to work as observed in MT5 charts.

Was just hoping you could give me some guidance?

You can see by the screenshot below,  where the jurik filter crosses in both the tester and mt5 charts.  The red arrow indicates where i am expecting price to cross the ja

Many thanks in advance.

The idea of this one is simple: it should "imitate" as much other moving averages as it can.

This version is showing the channel that needs to be broken if the trend is going to be changed.
