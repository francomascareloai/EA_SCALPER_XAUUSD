Fisher RVI is an oscillator that modifies [RVI](/ru/code/48) ([Relative Vigor Index](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rvi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/oscillators/rvi")) custom indicator values using [Inverse Fisher Transform](/en/articles/303).

The indicator is inspired by John Ehlers' article ["Using The Fisher Transform"](/go?link=http://www.mesasoftware.com/Papers/USING%2520THE%2520FISHER%2520TRANSFORM.pdf "http://www.mesasoftware.com/Papers/USING THE FISHER TRANSFORM.pdf") published in November 2002 in the ["Technical Analysis Of Stock & Commodities"](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.traders.com/ "http://www.traders.com/") magazine.

Trading rules are quite simple. It is time to buy when the indicator crosses the zero level upwards. It is time to sell when the indicator crosses the zero level downwards. Crossing the indicator signal line may also be used.

**Boosting RSI with the Modified Inverse Fisher Transform (MIFT) - Part 1**

Upside price action can be in sharp contrast to what is experienced to the downside. "The market goes down like an elevator but up like an escalator," as prices tend to fall faster than they rise. At the same time, technical indicators, such as the well-known Relative Strength Index (RSI), treat rising prices the same as falling prices. Adjusting the indicator distribution with the Modified Inverse Fisher Transform (MIFT) helps to account for those differences and provides new trading applications. This paper will introduce the TSLabs: Modified Inverse Fisher Transform custom indicator with practical examples to explore and apply in trading.
