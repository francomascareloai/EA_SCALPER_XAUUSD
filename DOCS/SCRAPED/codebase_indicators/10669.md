How to work:

3. Copy this file to terminal\_data\_folder\experts\files;
4. In MetaTrader 4 select a currency pair window;
5. Drop the StrategyView script;
6. Set the "statement.csv" filename (if neccessary);
7. Set the correct hour offset (if neccessary);
8. Press OK and you will see the orders in your chart.

MrChuckW:

I am looking for a script exactly as described in the link below. I am not getting anything painted on my charts. Am I saving the file in the right format?   What is meant by "right up corner" when saving to .csv ?   Does anyone have experience with this script?  Is there another script/program that will do the same thing?   This is the only one I have seen.  any help would be appreciated.
