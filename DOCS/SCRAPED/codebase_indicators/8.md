[Average Directional Movement Index Wilder](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/admiw "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/admiw") (ADX Wilder) helps to determine if there is a market trend.

This technical indicator is constructed as a strict correspondence with the algorithm described by Welles
Wilder in his book ["New concepts in technical trading systems"](/go?link=https://www.amazon.com/New-Concepts-Technical-Trading-Systems/dp/0894590278 "http://www.amazon.com/New-Concepts-Technical-Trading-Systems/dp/0894590278").

Trading rules of this indicator are described in the [Average Directional Movement Index](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/admi "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/admi").

**Calculation:**

First positive (dm\_plus) and negative (dm\_minus) changes at each bar are calculated, as well as the true range tr:

If High(i) - High(i-1) > 0  dm\_plus(i) = High[(i) - High(i-1), otherwise dm\_plus(i) = 0.  

If Low(i-1) - Low(i) > 0  dm\_minus(i) = Low(i-1) - Low(i), otherwise dm\_minus(i) = 0.

tr(i) = Max(ABS(High(i) - Low(i)), ABS(High(i) - Close(i-1)), ABS(Low(i) - Close(i-1)))

where:

* High(i) - maximum price of the current bar;
* Low(i) - minimum price of the current bar;
* High(i-1) - maximum price of the previous bar;
* Low(i-1) - minimum price of the previous bar;
* Close(i-1) - close price of the previous bar;
* Max (a, b , c) - maximum value out of three numbers: a, b и c;
* ABS(X)  - absolute value of the X.

After that the smoothed values are calculated: Plus\_D(i), Minus\_D(i) and ATR():

ATR(i) = SMMA(tr, Period\_ADX,i)  
Plus\_D(i) = SMMA(dm\_plus, Period\_ADX,i)/ATR(i)\*100  
Minus\_D(i) = SMMA(dm\_minus, Period\_ADX,i)/ATR(i)\*100

where:

  

* SMMA(X, N, i) - [Smoothed Moving Average](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma "https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/ma") of X series on the current bar;
* Perod\_ADX - number of bars, used for calculation.

Now Directional Movement Index - DX(i) - is calculated:

DX(i) = ABS(Plus\_D(i) - Minus\_D(i))/(Plus\_D(i) + Minus\_D(i)) \* 100

After preliminary calculations we obtain the value of the ADX(i) indicator on the current bar by smoothing DX index values:

ADX(i) = SMMA(DX, Perod\_ADX, i)

First, the positive (dm\_plus) and negative (dm\_minus) changes at each bar are calculated, as well as the true range of tr:

Если High(i) - High(i-1) > 0  dm\_plus(i) = High[(i) - High(i-1), иначе dm\_plus(i) = 0.  

If Low(i-1) - Low(i) > 0 dm\_minus(i) = Low(i-1) - Low(i), otherwise dm\_minus(i) = 0.

![](https://c.mql5.com/3/0/di.jpg)

If High(i) - High(i-1) > 0 dm\_plus(i) = High[(i) - High(i-1), else dm\_plus(i) = 0.  

If Low(i-1) - Low(i) > 0 dm\_minus(i) = Low(i-1) - Low(i), else dm\_minus(i) = 0.

If (dm\_plus(i)>dm\_minus(i)) dm\_minus(i) = 0;

otherwise {

if (dm\_plus(i)<dm\_minus(i)) dm\_plus(i)=0;

otherwise dm\_minus(i) = 0,dm\_plus(i)=0;

}

Is there an MT5 [Android version](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/mobile-trading/android "MetaTrader 5 - Android Mobile Trading Terminal") of this indicator?

The Adaptive Moving Average Indicator is used for constructing a moving average with low sensitivity to price series noises and is characterized by the minimal lag for trend detection.
