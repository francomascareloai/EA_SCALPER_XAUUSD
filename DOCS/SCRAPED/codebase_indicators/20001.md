After back testing, we usually need to analyze the testing result on a new chart which we have loaded our template,in this case we need to copy the objects on the testing chart to the new chart.

This script helps to save the objects into a file and show the objects on a new chart.

### Usage

* After testing finished,run the script on the testing chart,select SAVE for the input SaveOrShow.
* Open a new chart,load your template, run the script on the new chart,select SHOW for the input SaveOrShow.

Can this copy objects from MT4 to MT5? I tried, but cannot get that to work so far.

An EX4 can only run on a MT4 terminal. Convert the source to MT5 and compile it.
