There are 2 input parameters:

1. AtrMultiplier: The lines will have this\* the current Atr value distance from the moving averages.
2. Period: High and Low moving average, Atr period.

The basic idea is to have 6 lines: upper will be 2\*atrmultiplier\*atr +HighMA, second then atrmultiplier\*atr + HighMA... Very easy to understand,
