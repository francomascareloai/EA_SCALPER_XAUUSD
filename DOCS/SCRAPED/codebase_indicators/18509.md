There is only one external variable and that is Maximum spread. Set this to the maximum spread you wish to see inside of your Market Watch window. I built this script because I got tried of scrolling, removing, and adding different elements to my Market Watch window.

Hi John,

I think it will be very good to be able cleaning any other instrument but Forex.  Would you please make it as an alternative version?

Thank you.

Hey John, thanks for this nifty tool saves time, however can it have an option to filter only say Forex symbols, and hide the remaining i.e for stocks, commodities, indices etc.. I'm sure people would want that option 110%.

I like the idea of filtering only for forex symbols, just don't know how to do it. I could say do all the major eight. I guess the main problem is figuring out what is different between a forex symbol and a non-forex symbol. Code wise they seem to be treated the same. If MetaTrader had some type of flag that I could use that would make it easier. Now, I could have it [check](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") against a list of known good symbols, however, new symbols would be excluded, and I probably would miss some exotic pairs, and then there is the problem of different brokers using different symbols.

![Multi Timeframe Bollinger Bands](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Multi Timeframe Bollinger Bands](/en/code/17673)

This is a multi timeframe indicator for Bollinger Bands. With it you can plot the Bollinger Bands of the higher timeframes without changing the current chart. This allows you to more clearly understand the price context by seeing the levels of the other timeframes on the same chart.
