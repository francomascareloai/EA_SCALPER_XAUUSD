I do not think there is a difference. I have used the Bars function a lot when I wasn't aware of rates\_total. It remained with me as a habit.

I'm understood, thank you. I asked in order to make sure that there were no nuances unknown to me😄

In fact I started coding as a freelancer when I knew absolutely nothing about a standard coding habit.

I think almost everyone here starts this way, and I’m no exception.

This is a special path - when interest in trading gives rise to interest in programming😄
