MQL5 version of MQL4 indicator :

[https://www.mql5.com/en/code/25473](/en/code/25473)

One of the "classics" but with a twist - unlike the built in fractals indicator, this one allows you to :

* adjust the fractals period (the built in fractal indicator is using period 5)
* chose prices for high and low (might be useful in some cases - in extreme whipsaw market conditions, for example)

PS: also, the way how fractals are calculated does not prevent having fractal up and fractal down at the same bar and that is a correct way how it should be calculated. Limiting it to just one fractal per bar is introducing a bias that has no mathematical cause

Sir, Why This Indicator Didn't Work For Me. I Compile That; And Use It To My MT5 Chart.
But It's Shows Nothing...
