**Float MetaTrader indicator** — a sophisticated indicator that analyzes the previous chart history for the given currency pair and then tries to analyze the trends in the current situation. It shows where trends start and end in a separate chart window and Fibonacci retracement levels combined with DiNapoli levels on the main chart. It also displays how long ago the local high and low were detected. This indicator is available for MT4 and MT5.

The indicator repaints its levels based on all the bars it analyzes (200 by default). This means that you cannot use its detections of new peaks or troughs as trading signals as they will be revised based on how market situation develops further. This indicator should be used only for the analysis of trend swing durations and important chart levels.

## Input parameters

* **Float** (default = 200) — the number of bars to process for trend analysis. The lower is the number means more up-to-date data but less accurate analysis.
* **ObjectPrefix** (default = "FI-") — prefix for chart objects for compatibility with other indicators.
* **DisableDinapoli** (default = false) — if *true*, then DiNapoli levels won't be drawn in the main chart window.
* **DisableFibonacci** (default = false) — if *true*, then Fibonacci levels won't be drawn in the main chart window.
* **DrawVerticalLinesAsBackground** (default = false) — if *true*, vertical lines for trend start and end will be set as chart background to avoid concealing the chart itself.
* **SwingBorderColor** (default = clrBlue) — the color of the swing zone borders.
* **SwingBorderWidth** (default = 1) — the width of the swing zone borders.
* **SwingBorderStyle** (default = STYLE\_SOLID) — the line style for the swing zone borders.
* **SwingLinesColor** (default = clrRed) — the color of the swing lines.
* **SwingLinesWidth** (default = 1) — the width of the swing lines.
* **SwingLinesStyle** (default = STYLE\_DOT) — the line style for the swing lines.
* **FiboColor** (default = clrGreen) — the color of the Fibonacci levels.
* **FiboWidth** (default = 1) — the width of the Fibonacci levels.
* **FiboStyle** (default = STYLE\_DASH) — the line style for the Fibonacci levels.
* **DinapoliColor** (default = clrRed) — the color of the DiNapoli levels.
* **DinapoliWidth** (default = 1) — the width of the DiNapoli levels.
* **DinapoliStyle** (default = STYLE\_DOT) — the line style for the DiNapoli levels.

[Fisher Indicator MT4](/en/code/55384)

Fisher MetaTrader indicator — is quite a simple histogram indicator that detects the trend's direction and strength and signals about trend changes. It doesn't use any standard MT4/MT5 indicators in its code. Fisher bases its calculations on the maximum and minimum price levels from the previous periods, applying some advanced math calculations to the relations between the current price and the max/min prices. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5. This is a "repainting" indicator — it recalculates previous bars when a new bar arrives.

It offers a range of alerts: horizontal line appears, horizontal line cross, arrow up, arrow down, previous horizontal line cross (PHLC). Available for MT4 and MT5 platforms

[Keltner Channel MT4](/en/code/55391)

Keltner Channel (MetaTrader indicator) — is a classical technical analysis indicator developed by Chester W. Keltner in 1960. The indicator is somewhat similar to the Bollinger Bands and Envelopes. It uses three plot lines: the middle line is the 10-day simple moving average applied to the typical price ((high + low + close) / 3), the upper and the lower bands are produced by adding and subtracting the moving average of the daily price range (High and Low difference) from the middle line. This way, a volatility-based channel is built. In this version of the indicator you can modify all the parameters of the MA. The indicator is available both for MT4 and MT5 versions of the platform.
