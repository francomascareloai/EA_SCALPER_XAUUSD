Net Volume indicator:

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/161/terminal64_BTH0AnnBlf.png)

Net volume can be used to show where buyers and sellers are putting the most money at any given point in time. Positive net volume can show that growth and buying pressure exceeds selling pressure. Negative net volume shows the opposite. Net volume is designed to measure the selling or buying pressure of an asset over a period of time within each period.

In the indicator settings you can choose whether you want to use tick or real volume for calculation.

**Alex Renko [#](/ru/forum/465858#comment_54884061):**  
 You have Tick by default - why do you have different curves on the tick curve when you change the TF? What is the point if you have to read ticks and not TFs?

It is natural - different timeframes will have different amount of tick volumes. The higher the timeframe, the more ticks per bar.

Author: [Artyom Trishkin](/ru/users/artmedia70 "artmedia70")

Tick volume in Forex shows how many times the price has changed over a selected period and does not take into account the type of transaction. That is, on the tick volume can not make a conclusion about who prevails in the market, bulls or bears. We can only judge about the trading activity. In this case the indicator will show the pressure very relatively. Usually such indicator is called Market-Delta.
