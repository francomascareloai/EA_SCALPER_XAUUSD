The HighPass-LowPass Roofing Filter was created by John Ehlers (Cycle Analytics For Traders pg.78)

This is a variation of a roofing filter that will let you know which direction the stock is trending. If it falls below 0 then the stock is in a downtrend and if it rises above 0 then it is an uptrend. Buy when the indicator line is green and sell when it is red.

The version for MetaTrader 4 will not be presented here. You can download it along with the source code through my Telegram channel. The link to the channel is in my [profile](/en/users/andreifx60). Don't forget to subscribe!

After the three average lines are arranged completely according to high and low, it can be regarded as a trend formation. After the pattern is destroyed, the hatching is no longer drawn
Under the condition of no hatching, it is regarded as an indeterminate period
