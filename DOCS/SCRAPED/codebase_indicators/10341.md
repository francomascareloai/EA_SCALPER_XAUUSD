Thank you for your code. It works fine in [strategy Tester](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/239 "Article \"The Fundamentals of Testing in MetaTrader 5\"") MQl4, however, if I try to attach it to a chart it doen get attached. What is the solution?

Thanks for your quick respond. I was able to run the program and attach it after I deleted this line:   

```mql5
#property indicator_chart_window
```

Another question I have is that how I could show many lines on the chart using your EA. For example, with one command and using \"n\ you could show more lines on the chart. Thank you for your help.

You simply put the indicator in experts file That was wrong

Indicators belong In subdirectory of experts called indicators

If you had opened that map and put it in there then there was no need to delete

```mql5
#property indicator_chart_window
```

You will find the program then if you open the platform by [Custom Indicators](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/5 "Step on New Rails: Custom Indicators in MQL5")

Your other question is something to ask at **Forum**
