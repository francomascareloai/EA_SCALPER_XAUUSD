Hi there, could you tell me how after a test there was 400 trades, then after changing a few thing it threw up about 90, then after undoing the recent changes and putting back to its origonal settings, there was still about 90-100 trades. I was expecting the test to show around 400 trades again but it seems not, there was no change in the times or dates, these were the same as the origonal first test.I'm new to MQL so please go easy on me and not too techno, Rob, I have gone back to the sample because i'm having similar probles elsewhere.
