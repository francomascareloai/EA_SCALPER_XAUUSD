In short "repulse" would be :

The Repulse indicator measures and displays the bullish or bearish
pressure associated with each price candlestick in the form of a curve.

It is more relevant when compared to price and offers valuable
additional information on the feeling and confidence that traders have
about the markets.

This version can use one of the 4 basic averages types for smoothing.

Coloring can be chosen depending on :

* slope
* outer levels cross
* middle ("zero") level cross

Since the "repulse" indicator is not limited to known bounds, levels are dynamic — the "zero" value too. That makes it more responsive in the times of elevated volatility. Alerts are triggered based on the color change.
