A simple tool to quickly get text characters on the chart to use for Elliot wave letter labels / numbers .

How to use:

It's a script so place it in scripts.

When you need the text just drag and drop the script close to where
you want to place the text. The text will appear on the next tick (or hit
refresh) and you can then move each letter /
number to where you want it .

To make changes to the text open the script in the MetaEditor and
make the changes. Should be pretty clear from the comments in the code
what to do to make changes.

If you want to keep multiple copies (i.e. one setup for numbers and
one setup for letters) just save them back as additional scripts with
unique names.

pls help

I downloaded script - it went to my downloads folder. I dragged it onto MT4 chart but it wasnt able to go there.

I then found my MT4 folder, MQL folder with an experts and indicators folders. I made a scripts folder and dragged the script into it.

Now what do I do? Dragging it onto the chart doesnt accept it.

thx

Hi there,

Any chance to add the possibility to make the text visible on specific time frame?

I've created several scripts with differente text and colors for each counting level, but want to make visible on the chart created and lower TF,

For instance:

Monthly waves visible on all charts

240 waves just visible on 240/60/30/15

A user modification such as text content, color, size, etc would be great.

Thanks

Hi,  
I also wanted to display the object display in a specific time frame.  
I added the following code to [control](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/310 "Article: Custom Graphic Controls Part 1. Creating a simple control") it.  
How about that?

```mql5
void TextToPrint(string TextName, string LabelText, int FontSize, string FontName, color TextColor, datetime Time0, double Price0)
  {
    if(StringLen(LabelText)<1) return(0);
    ObjectCreate(TextName, OBJ_TEXT, 0, Time0, Price0);
    ObjectSetText(TextName, LabelText, FontSize, FontName, TextColor);
    // Set object visualization. It is only displayed on the 5 minute, 15 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour, and 4 hour charts.
    ObjectSet(TextName, OBJPROP_TIMEFRAMES,  OBJ_PERIOD_M5 | OBJ_PERIOD_M15 | OBJ_PERIOD_M30 | OBJ_PERIOD_H1 | OBJ_PERIOD_H4) ;
  }
```

Let me apologize for my poor English.  
Thanks
