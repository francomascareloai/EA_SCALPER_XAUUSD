**aRSI Calculation & Usage:**

* Subtract 50 from RSI → take absolute value → divide by 100 or 50 (setting: *Divide RSI value by*) → gives **aRSI** (percentage-like).
* Bands adjustment:

  + Lower band = lower − (lower × aRSI)
  + Upper band = upper + (upper × aRSI)
* Option: Toggle *Show Regular ST* to view standard SuperTrend.

**Settings:**

* Factor (for both STs)
* ATR length (for STs)
* RSI length (for aRSI ST)

[ZIGZAG CALIBRATION TOOLS](/en/code/62603)

Allows you to easily visualize bullish and bearish periods confirmed by the zigzag indicator using vlines. You can control the display of the zigzag, choosing to start from the beginning of the chart or from a certain number of bars, as well as the display of labels showing the price of the peak or trough, the direction of the past period, and its amplitude in pips. Of course, it works on the main window as well as on sub-windows.
