Development of the first version of [MA Trend](/en/code/23589) - added **Type traiding** restriction parameter:

* Only BUY - allowed to open only BUY
* Only SELL - it is allowed to open only SELL
* BUY and SELL - it is allowed to open both BUY and SELL.

The Expert Advisor works according to the iMA (Moving Average, MA) indicator. It has many settings:

* **Only one positions** -**only one** position can be held in the market
* **Reverse** - reverse (flip) trading signals
* **Close opposite** - forced closing of opposite positions when a trading signal is received.

Formation of trading signals when all parameters are set by default:

Current ASK price is higher than the indicator value on bar #1 -> signal to open BUY position

Current BID price is less than the indicator value on bar #1 -> signal to open a SELL position.

and how it looks like in MQL5 code:

```mql5
      if(m_symbol.Ask()>ma[1])
         m_need_open_buy=true;
      else if(m_symbol.Bid()<ma[1])
         m_need_open_sell=true;
```

Example of operation when **Only one positions** parameters are false and true:

![MA Trend](https://c.mql5.com/18/160/2018-12-10_06h41_48__1.png "MA Trend")

The following example **Only one positions** - true, **Reverse** - false and **Close opposite** - true: a BUY position was opened, after some time a signal to open SELL position was received. Since **Close opposite** is true, the BUY position was closed first (because it is opposite to the signal) and only then the SELL position was opened.

**Nikolay Nikolaeff:**  

Can you tell me, do you plan to develop this EA in the future?

There are suggestions for its improvement, but unfortunately I am not good at programming.

Yes, this series is being developed. For example, I rewrote it as a class and made it multisymbol: [Multicurrency iMA Trend](/ru/code/24228)

Great. I will then try to describe its weak side and a possible solution.

The point is that in case of a moderate or long pullback, the Expert Advisor continues to [open positions](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/performing_deals#position_manage "Help: Opening and closing positions in MetaTrader 5 trading terminal") in the opposite direction of the formed trend.

This happens until the moment of receiving a reverse signal and the bulk of the profit received during the trend movement, unfortunately, is drained.

One of the ways to solve this problem is to attach a standard parabolic to the Expert Advisor as a filter, the task of which is not to open counter-trend positions.

For example:

Signal to open a BUY position: The current ASK price is higher than the indicator value on bar #1 and the point of the parabolic is below the price.

Signal to open a SELL position: The current price BID is less than the indicator value on bar #1 and the point of the parabolic is above the price.

Of course, this is not a panacea, not a grail and not a protection from the drain, but one way or another, 60-70% of counter-trend entries will disappear by themselves.
