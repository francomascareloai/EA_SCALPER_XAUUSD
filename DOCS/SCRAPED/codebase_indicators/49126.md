My pleasure. its subject of research how you wish to use it. This is usually grown and used by Malaysian traders and its usually seen after a breakout as a confirmation.

After previous experiences, this type of candle is an illusion. It may succeed once and fail 66 times.

The funny thing is, it works when we move past it, meaning when it becomes part of the past archive, but it fails when we are experiencing it in real-time and trying to apply it. 😀

Its an illusion with everything you try as a beginner in trading,

In backtest even engulfing seems to be working, but you never know data when you test it in last 1 year of chart.

Must follow these steps before using any system

1. Find Cause such as trend or any signal your strategy gives such as ABC wave.

2. Validate the cause - by any means such as breakout of any structure ABC confirms the structure, the structure made ABC wave is not a validated structure.

3. Enter after successful validation

4. Find Exit

Dominant candle is used mostly for point 2 (validation)
