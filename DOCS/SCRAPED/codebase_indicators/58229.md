### What exactly is it for?

* Visual reference of the performance of your EAs: Enter manually the known or expected Historical Maximum Drawdown of your strategy (for example, the one obtained in backtesting or previous results). This way, you will always have a clear reference to know if your EA is within normal parameters or is going through an unexpected situation.
* Continuous monitoring of the current risk: You can also use it to monitor the current drawdown in real time and check if you are exceeding critical levels that require your immediate attention.
* Intelligent and detailed notifications: The indicator sends push notifications (to your mobile phone via the MetaTrader app) every time a new drawdown record is set, or periodically (depending on your settings), to keep you in the loop without cluttering you with unnecessary messages.
* Automatic logging: Allows you to continuously record drawdown in an external file (CSV or TXT) for later analysis.

### Who is it for?

* Traders who operate with automatic or semi-automatic systems and  want to know quickly if their EA is behaving within the maximum expected drawdown.
* Users who need to visually check the performance of their strategies in  real conditions against expectations based on previous tests.
* Any trader who wants to effectively manage their risk, knowing immediately when their trading is outside acceptable limits.

## Detailed configuration guide (Inputs)

These are all the customisable parameters of the indicator:

1. Magics to monitor (-1 tracks all)  
    Specifies the Magic Numbers of the positions to track. Use -1  to  monitor all.

    This is where you enter the known Historical Maximum Drawdown of your EA (i.e. the maximum result obtained in a long backtest). This will serve as a visual reference.
3. Refresh Interval (seconds)  
    How often the calculations are refreshed.
4. MaxDDD update mode  
    Defines how the historical maximum is updated:
   * UPDATE\_MAX\_DD\_IF\_BIGGER: Automatically updates if the current exceeds the entered historical.
   * NO\_UPDATE\_MAX\_DD: Never updates the manually entered historical value, but sends notifications every 60 minutes about the current status.
5. Send push notifications?  
    Enables or disables push notifications to the mobile phone.
6. Fixed or peak reference?  
    Choose how to define the balance reference:
   * REF\_FIXED\_BALANCE: Fixed balance, entered manually.
   * REF\_PEAK\_BALANCE: Always use the maximum balance reached (automatically saved).
7. Fixed balance (0 => current)  
    Fixed initial balance. If you use 0 , the current balance is taken when loading the indicator.
8. Colour for current DD text  
    Colour of the current drawdown text.

### Automatic logging to file

Drawdown values are automatically logged along with date and time in CSV or TXT format, located in the common MT5 folder*(MetaTrader 5 Terminal/Common/Files/*). Ideal for later analysis of your results.

### Important recommendations to get the most out of it

* Always enter the expected Historical Maximum Drawdown (  backtesting result, previous performance, etc.) in the input*"Initial Max DD (%)".* This will allow you to quickly assess whether your EA is going through a normal period or needs adjustments.
* Place the indicator on a dedicated chart, monitoring all the magic numbers, or on each specific chart if you prefer separate data.
* Carefully adjust the refresh rate, colours, position and text size for optimal display according to your preferences.
