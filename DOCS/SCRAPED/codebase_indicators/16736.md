Hi, the same problem as I have. when I set the indiactor in M1 to timeframe M5 or other, the indicator doesn´t paint. Could you kindly provide a solution for this?

Even though that is a very old code and I do not do multi time framing like that any more, it still works as expected

Just downloaded the code from the link and attached it to the chart - no changes whatsoever made
