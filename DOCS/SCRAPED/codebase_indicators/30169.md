**Power of XXX with average indicator description.**

**Version 229.201**

The indicator is new version of previously published indicator showing relative actual strength of currency XXX.

Zero line (0.0) presents average with chosen period (**AveragePeriod** variable).

The indicator calculates its value of close prices of 7 pairs containing currency XXX.

Colored histogram was added to simplify interpretation of the market situation.

Now you have 2 mode options to choose:

+ TREND
+ COUNTER-TREND

The same color on BASE and QUOTE in equal mode means higher oportunity to trade in correct direction.

**Instance 1 = BUY:**

**EUR USD.**

You chose mode TREND for ***Power of EUR with average*** and for ***Power of USD with average.***

Both indicators show **GREEN** color you should be prepared to **BUY** pair EUR USD.

**Instance 2 = SELL:**

**EUR USD.**

You chose mode TREND for ***Power of EUR with average*** and for ***Power of USD with average.***

Both indicators show **RED** color you should be prepared to **SELL** pair EUR USD.

Rapainting?

Only actual candle.

Which is correct because actual candle is changing.

Regards .

IN what instance would you select counter trend? do you have to see what the main trend is on Daily then select trend or counter trend depending on what direction you are trading?

Thanks,

Chris

Hi Chris,

there are plenty of different opinions telling you why, when and where (on which price level) you should trade WITH the trend or AGAINST the trend.

My view is that there is no generally applicable rule.

You can try to choose COUNTER-TREND mode after the price fall and TREND mode in other cases but only if the trend does not last too long.

Finally you have to test it yourself and consider what works for you.

Regards.

Jan.

Thank you Jan! I really like your "Power of ... with average" indicators. Can you add an alert when crossing the zero line? That would be really useful. Also, is it possible to use a higher value for the moving average? I prefer to trade on 1 [minute timeframe](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/chartconstants/enum_timeframes "MQL5 documentation: Chart Timeframes") and would like to use higher values for the MA (240 seems to work fine, but something like 1440 doesn't seem to work). Once again, thank you for the indicators.

An oscillator that duplicates the chart of a selected asset in a separate window in three ways: line, bars and candles. This is essentially an indicator Bollinger bands, displayed in a separate window. In my opinion, it will be useful for beginners as a way to look at various technical signals from a different angle. This indicator helped me in an adviser for filtering unfavorable moments for trades.
