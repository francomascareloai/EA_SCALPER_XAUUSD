**Round Levels MetaTrader indicator** — an MT4/MT5 indicator that can display round levels and zones near them based on your configuration. It can be useful to trade off the natural psychological support and resistance zones. It can also issue alerts when the price is in either support or resistance zone.

## Input parameters

* **Levels** (default = 5) — the number of round levels to process in each direction (up and down).
* **Interval** (default = 50) — the interval in points between round levels. For example, the default value of 50 means that a level will be drawn each 50 points.
* **ZoneWidth** (default = 10) — the width of the zone in points.
* **ColorUp** (default = clrFireBrick) — the color of the round level zones that will be drawn above the current price.
* **ColorDn** (default = clrDarkGreen) — the color of the round level zones that will be drawn below the current price.
* **InvertZones** (default = false) — inverted zones are highlighted with the colors outside the zone boundaries vs. inside in non-inverted zones.
* **ZonesAsBackground** (default = true) — if *true*, round number zones will be drawn behind the chart plot (candlesticks, bars, or line).
* **DrawLines** (default = false) — if *true*, lines will be drawn at round levels in addition to zones.
* **LineColor** (default = clrDarkGray) — the color of the round level lines.
* **LineWidth** (default = 1) — the width of the round level lines.
* **LineStyle** (default = STYLE\_DASHDOT) — the style of the round level lines.
* **LinesAsBackground** (default = false) — if *true*, round number zones will be drawn behind the chart plot (candlesticks, bars, or line).
* **ShowLineLabels** (default = false) — if *true*, a line label will be drawn to mark the price level of each line.
* **LineLabelColor** (default = clrWhite) — line labels' color.
* **ObjectPrefix** (default = "RoundLevels") — the prefix to add to the chart object names. Only change this if there are conflicts with some other indicators on the chart.
* **EnableNotify** (default = false) — if *true*, the indicator will issue notifications when the price (Bid) is in the zone.
* **SendAlert** (default = true) — if *true* and the notifications are enabled, the indicator will use built-in popup alerts.
* **SendApp** (default = false) — if *true* and the notifications are enabled, the indicator will use push-notification alerts.
* **SendEmail** (default = false) — if *true* and the notifications are enabled, the indicator will use email alerts.
* **AlertDelay** (default = 5) — the delay in seconds between consecutive alerts.

By default, the maximum band is displayed with a blue line; the minimum band is displayed with a yellow line. Additionally, it can invoke a popup alert, send an email alert, or issue a notification alert when the current price (Bid) breaks recent High or Low level. All alerts can be turned off. If you use the email alert feature, do not forget to set the email settings in your MetaTrader platform's options window. Same with push-notifications. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5.

![Range Expansion Index (REI) MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Range Expansion Index (REI) MT4](/en/code/55501)

Range Expansion Index (MetaTrader indicator) — is a relative oscillator indicator that measures the pace of the price changes and signals overbought/oversold states if the price demonstrates weakness or strength. It was developed by Tom DeMark and explained in his book The New Science of Technical Analysis. The value of the indicator changes from -100 to +100. The REI is an enhanced oscillator because it tries to remain calm during the range trading and indicates signals only when the significant peaks or bottoms are spotted. You can download this indicator both for MT4 and MT5.

![RSIOMA MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[RSIOMA MT4](/en/code/55508)

RSIOMA MetaTrader indicator — this indicator takes two moving averages, calculates their RSI (Relative Strength Index) and then also adds a moving average of the calculated RSI. These two lines now can accurately signal the trend changes. They are shown in the separate window where they change from 0 to 100. The auxiliary histogram is shown for a quick-glance view of the current trend. The indicator is available for both MT4 and MT5 versions of the MetaTrader platform.

![Schaff Trend Cycle MT4](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Schaff Trend Cycle MT4](/en/code/55510)

Schaff Trend Cycle (MetaTrader indicator) — is a cyclical oscillator created by calculating the stochastic over stochastic over a MACD line using cycles. The result is the improved version of the oscillator that is not choppy during the trends and reacts to the changes very fast. It was developed by Doug Schaff, who assumed that the currency trends accelerate and decelerate in cycles. Its algorithm was made public in 2008. Schaff Trend Cycle tries to combine two different methods of determining the trend direction changes — MACD and smoothed stochastic oscillator. The value of the indicator fluctuates between 0 and 100. Two trigger levels are used — 25 and 75. Optional alerts are available. You can download this indicator for MT4, MT5
