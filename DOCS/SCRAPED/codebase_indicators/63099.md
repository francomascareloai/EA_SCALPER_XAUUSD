The **Balance of Power (BOP)** is an indicator originally developed by Igor Livshin in 2001 to measure the balance of power between buyers and sellers during each candle.  
 In this version, we've used a **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** to smooth out the calculation, reducing noise and making it clearer to read.

This indicator visually shows **who is in control of the market**:

* **Buyers (bulls)**, when the close is close to the high;
* **Sellers (bears)**, when the close is close to the low.

The basis of the calculation is:

**BOP = (Close - Open) / (High - Low)**

**BOP > 0** - buyer dominance  
 **BOP < 0** - seller dominance  
 **BOP ≈ 0** - balance or indecision  
 **Extreme zones (e.g. ±0.2)** - can indicate situations of exaggerated strength that tend towards correction
