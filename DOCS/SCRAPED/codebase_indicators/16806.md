**Definition of 'Dynamic Momentum Index'**

An indicator used in technical analysis that determines overbought
and oversold conditions of a particular asset. This indicator is very
similar to the relative strength index (RSI). The main difference
between the two is that the RSI uses a fixed number of time periods
(usually 14), while the dynamic momentum index uses different time
periods as volatility changes.

**Explaination of 'Dynamic Momentum Index'**

This indicator is interpreted in the same manner as the RSI where
readings below 30 are deemed to be oversold and levels over 70 are
deemed to be overbought. The number of time periods used in the dynamic
momentum index decreases as volatility in the underlying asset
increases, making this indicator more responsive to changing prices than
the RSI.

This version has an additional smoothing in a form of using RSX for
calculation not the original RSI. It has been added in order to make it a
bit more readable. The original Chande's DMI is less smooth than this
version and can raise more false signals. Using the rsx instead of rsi
does not add any lag at all so we can say that using an rsx instead of
rsi could be clasified as the "1% improvement" rule — what is sure that
it is not worse than the original Chande's DMI.

Hi Mladen,  
Thank you for the this indicator.  
  

The "Period of [Standard Deviation](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/indicators/trend_indicators/sd "MetaTrader 5 Help: Standard Deviation Indicator")" parameter appears to be non-functional on any chart on the latest version MT5.

In all parameters I tested, there was no change in the indicator.

Could this parameter or indicator have a problem with current MT5 versions?
