Calculation is:

----------------------

Calculation is current close price minus the close price of the last N(default 30) period's defined X(default 60) upper quantile &

current close price minus the close price of the last N(default 30) period's defined X(default 40) lower quantile.

If both of these value(which are displayed in histograms) are above 0 then it is uptrend, vice versa for down trend, if one of them is > 0 and one of them is < 0, then it is ranging.

-----------------------

There is also a high low mode in the inputs, Calculation is current High price minus the close price of the last N(default 30) period's defined X(default 60) upper quantile & current Low price minus the close price of the last N(default 30) period's defined X(default 40) lower quantile.

If both of these value(which are displayed in histograms) are above 0 then it is uptrend, vice versa for down trend, if one of them is > 0 and one of them is < 0, then it is ranging.

This method filters more ranging bars but also produces more lag.

-----------------------  
  
Green Block at the 0 level means uptrend, Orange Block at the 0 level means downtrend, Gray Block at the 0 level means Ranging.

Fast and accurate, totally non-repainting, very useful for trend depiction with the right settings.

[Save current chart to default template](/en/code/37669)

it saves the current chart to default template , it just helps to do it faster than a manual save. you can assign a hotkey for it.
it has no confirmation and immediately saves the template, if you want it to save to a template other than default just edit the code and replace "default.tpl" to any other name you want.
