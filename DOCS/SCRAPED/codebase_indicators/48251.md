**DauCatMoi [#](/en/forum/462715/page2#comment_54170413):**  

from 10k 💀

Hey there DauCatMoi,

I am just curious, are these result from this bot? Using a live or demo account? Just wondering if EAs really work, I have never used one, only traded manually but looking into EAs for the first time.

if(EntrySell1 && EntrySell2 && EntrySell3) result = true; In my opinion result = true; should be replaced by result = [ORDER\_TYPE\_SELL](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties#enum_order_type "MQL5 documentation:");
Do you think so?
Thanks

Results were poor with these settings when I tested in November and December.  
How are the current settings not working? Can you help me?  
At what values ​​will running it give better results?
