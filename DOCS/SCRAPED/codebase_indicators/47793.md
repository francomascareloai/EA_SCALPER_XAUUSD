function to calculate the cosine distance and the cosine similarity.

The cosine distance between 2 vectors A and B is :

So 1-CosineSimilarity

And the cosine similarity is :

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/153/cosine_similarity.png)

In simple terms :

* the cosine of the angle between the 2 vectors
* or , the dot product of the vectors divided by their magnitudes multiplied

Here is the simplest explanation (although his cos(45) is wrong) :
