 Doesn't work

You may need to change the time zone setting.

 This one runs fine based on the system time, I do it myself based on the K-line going, and the countdown can get stuck when the network or the market gets stuck.

Feel free to contribute your ideas here

 It's interesting to know that such a quote function has been created in mt5 - congratulations

Thanks for the recognition! 😊.

I understand that this version is incomplete, but if you like the idea or find this indicator useful, it really is an important tool to help traders monitor candles in a more organised way.

Good luck to you and happy trading.

Takes trades based on ICT silverbullet and 2022 model with trailing stops and partials, also keeps entry according to OTE, and risk minimal.
It works in a small time window of silver bullet especially NY session, and if no trade found, 2022 model and fibonacci OTE jumps in to get a trade. But entry is so only after confirmation with these models being there, hence trades will be less for minimal drawdown and high winrate. To know more about these strategies, you may visit Inner Circle Trader YouTube channel.
