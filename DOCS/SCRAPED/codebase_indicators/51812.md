The script creates a text object on the chart that continuously rotates and changes its position based on price levels. While running, the text changes color and content depending on its position, adding a dynamic visual element to the chart. This can be particularly useful for traders who want to add annotations or dynamic markers directly to their charts.

[The Doji Candelstick Pattern](/en/code/52297)

The Doji Pattern Detector EA is designed to automatically detect the classic Doji candlestick pattern on any chart. A Doji pattern occurs when the open and close prices of a candle are very close to each other, signaling market indecision. This EA identifies Doji candles where the open and close prices are within a small range and positioned near the midpoint of the candle's high and low.
