hi  
Adding the simultaneous display option of standard pivot and camarilla can really make this tool more complete

Also added graphic settings for each line separately  
Because some lines are less [important](https://www.mql5.com/en/economic-calendar/united-states/imports "US Economic Calendar: Imports"), such as  
R1, S1, R2, S2 on camarilla  
For example  
R3, S3  
Therefore, they need to have different colors and types of lines  
Thankful
