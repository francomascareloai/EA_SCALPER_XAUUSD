With this script, you can send a message from MetaTrader 4 to Telegram.

Put the code in the Scripts directory.

From the Main Menu-> Tools-> Options, tab Expert Advisors, add the following address in the Allow URLs section:

```mql5
https://api.telegram.org
```

In the code, customize the following variables:

Get the token robot token from @BotFather and enter it in the following variable:

```mql5
string token = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";
```

Get the recipient's chat ID from @userinfobot and enter it in the following variable:

```mql5
string chat_id = "xxxxx";
```

Enter the desired message in the following variable:

```mql5
string message = "Salam @JahanChart";
```

Be sure to either test on an external server that has no filtering problem, or if you are testing on your system, connect a filter breaker through which all network traffic passes. (Enabling MetaTrader internal proxy does not help)

how do you add charts to the entry and exits and add custom messages with each alert?
