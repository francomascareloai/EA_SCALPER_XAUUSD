The indicator searches for candlesticks on the price chart that are larger than the size specified in the settings and marks them on the chart.  
  
You can choose two types of candlestick size measurement (Units of Calculation): Points and Percentages.

Thank you. An indicator I was looking for. How can I adjust the settings to distinguish candles with equal upper and lower shadows?

Thank you! I am glad that the indicator is useful for you!  
The indicator does not provide such a possibility. You can only install two copies of the indicator on the chart with separate settings for the upper and lower shadows.

Thank you for your kind response.

No. The indicator analyzes only one bar. For an external bar, two candles are needed. This function is not included in the indicator.
