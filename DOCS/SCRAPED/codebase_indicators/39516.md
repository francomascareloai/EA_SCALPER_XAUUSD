Very useful. for using: if trend direction or slope is positive(up) you should select buy option of indicator and when trend is negative select send.

in by option when Aqua sign is in below of candle you can open buy.

In case you have not figured out yet, go to Indicator Settings (or Input, not sure the English name as I use the German MT4 version) and select Sell in the dropdown menu. If you want to see both colors, you have to put the indicator on the chart twice, once for buy, once for sell.

[Market High and Lows](/en/code/39489)

This indicator shows market highs and lows for any timeframe with period separators.
You can see daily/weekly/monthly highs/lows on lower timeframes like H1/M30/M40. This is good for trading breakouts.
