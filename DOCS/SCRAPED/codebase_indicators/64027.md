## What Is MA Cross Alert?

**MA Cross Alert** is a custom MT4 indicator that solves one key problem: MetaTrader’s built-in Moving Average shows the line but has no way to **alert you when price crosses it**.

This tool adds the missing feature by giving **instant notifications** whenever price moves **above or below the MA line**. It works for both **trend-following strategies** (trading with the trend) and **reversal strategies** (spotting breakouts against the trend).

---

## Why Is It Useful?

With **MA Cross Alert**, you don’t have to sit in front of charts waiting for price to cross a moving average.

* It alerts you the moment it happens.
* It can draw **arrows on the chart** showing buy/sell signals at each crossover.
* It supports all major MA types: **Simple (SMA), Exponential (EMA), Smoothed (SMMA), Linear Weighted (LWMA)**.

This makes it a flexible tool for both beginners and advanced traders who rely on MAs.

---

## Alerts & Notifications

You can choose how you want to be notified:

* **On-Screen Alerts** – Pop-up messages in MT4.
* **Mobile Push Notifications** – Alerts sent directly to the MT4 mobile app.
* **Email Notifications** – Emails sent whenever a cross is detected.

> ⚠️ Note: Mobile and email alerts require you to configure notifications in your MT4 platform settings.

---

## Signals on Chart

In addition to alerts, the indicator can mark signals visually:

* **Buy Arrow** → when price crosses **above** the MA.
* **Sell Arrow** → when price crosses **below** the MA.
* Optional labels for reviewing past signals.

This makes it easy to back-check signals and understand how often crosses happen.

---

## Input Parameters

### Moving Average Settings

* **MA Method** – Choose from SMA, EMA, SMMA, LWMA, or Hull MA.
* **MA Period** – Number of candles to calculate the average.
* **Applied Price** – Close, Open, High, Low, Median, Typical, or Weighted price.

### Signal Settings

* **Candle To Use For Analysis** –

  + **Current Candle:** Triggers as soon as price touches/crosses the MA. (Fast but may repaint)
  + **Previous Candle:** Confirms only after a candle closes across the MA. (Safer, fewer false signals)
* **Ignore Same Candle Crosses** – Filter out whipsaw signals caused by candles that open on one side and close on the other.
* **Number Of Candles To Analyze** – Limit checks to the most recent N candles for faster performance.

### Notifications

* **Enable Notifications Feature** – Master switch.
* **Send Alert Notification** – On-screen alerts.
* **Send Notification To Mobile** – Push notifications to your MT4 app.
* **Send Notification Via Email** – Email alerts when cross detected.

### Display Options

* **Show Arrows On Cross** – Draw buy/sell arrows.
* **Show Signal Labels** – Display labels with crossover info.

## Example Use Cases

**1. Trend Following Strategy**  
A trader sets the 50 EMA as the base line.

* When price closes **above** the EMA, MA Cross Alert shows a **Buy Arrow** and sends an alert.
* When price closes **below** the EMA, it shows a **Sell Arrow**.  
  ✅ Useful for staying with the bigger trend.

**2. Reversal Strategy**  
A trader uses the 200 SMA.

* When price crosses back **below** the 200 SMA, it signals a possible reversal.
* Alerts are sent instantly so the trader doesn’t miss the move.  
  ✅ Helps spot turning points at key levels.

**3. Multi-Timeframe Trading**  
Set alerts on both the **15M chart** (short-term moves) and the **H4 chart** (big trend).  
✅ Aligning signals across timeframes gives stronger confirmation.
