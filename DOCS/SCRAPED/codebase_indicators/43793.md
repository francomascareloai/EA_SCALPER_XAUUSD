If you're a trader who constantly juggles multiple open positions and needs to adjust stop losses as trades progress, you know how time-consuming and stressful this can be. But with MoveStoploss, you can take control of your trading strategy like never before.

This powerful tool allows you to monitor any manual trade and trail it at a distance specified by you or determined by the EA, giving you the flexibility you need to adapt to changing market conditions.

Whether you're working with currencies, commodities, crypto, or stocks, MoveStoploss can be used on all time frames, making it an incredibly versatile and valuable tool for traders of all levels. With the Auto trail feature, the EA will trail at its specified distance, freeing you up to focus on other aspects of your trading strategy. And when you need to take more control, simply set Auto trail to false and input your desired distance.

Don't let manual stop loss adjustments slow you down or add unnecessary stress to your trading. With MoveStoploss, you can automate the process and take control of your trades like never before. \*FREE TO DOWNLOAD [![](https://c.mql5.com/18/146/whed45__1.jpg)](https://c.mql5.com/18/146/whed45.jpg "https://c.mql5.com/18/146/whed45.jpg")\*

I could not get this thing to work. It would just give, what looked like, random numbers. If I put in 30 pips it would show 170 if I put in 200 it would show 55.

Kindly check the settings if is manual or automatic. What you are experiencing suggests that is automatically trailing

It doesn't matter if I click True or False for auto trail. I can put any number into distance to trail but a totally different number will show up. If I delete the EA the little smiley face stays on the chart and I can click it and make the numbers what ever I want them to be and they will then show up on the chart.  The smiley face never smiles by the way and if I click allow live trading it doesn't stay clicked). I think my broker has some kind of blocker on it. If brokers, that don't have trailing stops, don't allow your EA it's would be kind of pointless though. Not sure.
