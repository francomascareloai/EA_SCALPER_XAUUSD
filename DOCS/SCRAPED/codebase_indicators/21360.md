This tool is for trading with keyboard input, it supports "Send order", "Set Stop Loss", "Set Take Profit", and "Close order".

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/71/KeyboardTrade.gif)

### 1. Send Order

**Command**

Buy: b,lots,price,sl,tp

Sell: s,lots,price,sl,tp

**Example**

Buy 0.1 lots EURUSD on 1.16000, set Stop Loss on 1.15500, and set Take Profit on 1.17000

The command is:

b,0.1,1.16,1.155,1.17x

The last 'x' is to execute this command.

* If price is zero, or is equal to the Ask/Bid, the order type will be BUY/SELL.
* If the first command is 'b'(BUY), and price > Ask, the order type will be Buy Stop, if price < Ask, the order type will be Buy Limit.
* If the first command is 's'(SELL), and price > Bid, the order type will be Sell Limit, if price < Bid the order type will be Sell Stop.

### 2. Modify Order

Setting Stop Loss and Take Profit are supported only.

**Command**

Set Stop Loss: sl,ticket,sl

Set Take Profit: tp,ticket,tp

**Example**

If there is an EURUSD buy order, the Stop Loss is 1.1550, and the ticket is 123456789.

Now we set the Stop Loss to 1.1580, the command is:

sl,123456789,1.1580x

The last 'x' is to execute this command.

### 3. Close or Delete Order

**Command**

c,ticket

**Example**

If we want to close an order with the ticket 123456789

The command is:

c,123456789x

The last 'x' is to execute this command.

### 4. Other Commands

* ',' is to separate the command.
* 'ESC' or double 'z' will clear the command.
* 'x' is to execute the command.
