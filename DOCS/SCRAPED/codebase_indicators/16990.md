Well known iTrend indicator made for MetaTrader5

---

In order to extend it (apart of making it use the visual tools that are available in MetaTrader 5 now), it is  :

* multi time frame
* it has  the usual set of alerts :

+ alerts on current (still opened) or on a closed bar
+ alert displaying a message
+ alert playing a sound
+ alert sending an email
+ alert sending a push notification

* it has a choice of 4 types of averages used for calculation
* and it has the set of 22 price types

As a deviation compared to the wide spread version, this version has an adjustable level that is used to determine trend change (and continuation) that can be set to desired extremes look-back period and value. Once when that level is broken the trend is kept as long as the opposite direction value does not brake that level

Hello, can you please explain how to interpret this indicator and what information can I extract from it?

What is the benefit of the iTrend bar above bands? How can I change settings to make it identical to its MT4 standard version?

Thanks!

Dear Mladen,

Appreciate your work but,...

Please don't make indicators more complicated than nessecary. Please just make it working as in MT4. That really helps. For instance, easy comparing is possible then and the indicator makes a better change to be compatible in converted MT4 code.

When done that make an other publication of a version that offers some more. And make clear what the advantage is. Most added bells/colors and so on do no good but only harm and give extensive noise.

Thanks!

Dear "Marine",

Please check that this part of the code base is metatrader 5 code base - for metatrader 4 code please check metatrader 4 branch of the code base

Please check how the original iTrend indicator was coded, what it is supposed to do and how it is supposed to do it

Please, fee free to check and test the code before you post a suggestion of how and why it should be changed

And last, but not the least : please feel free to not to use any code you find on the internet (for free)

Thanks!
