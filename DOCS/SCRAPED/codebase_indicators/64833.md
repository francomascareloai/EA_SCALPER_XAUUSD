![Reverse Engineered RSI (MT4)](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Reverse Engineered RSI (MT4)](/en/code/64759)

Reverse Engineered RSI projects traditional RSI levels — 30, 50, and 70 — directly onto the price chart instead of the oscillator window.
This lets traders see where RSI overbought, oversold, and equilibrium zones align with actual market prices, making it easier to spot precise support, resistance, and potential reversal levels without switching views or relying on hidden momentum data.

[TakeStop](/en/code/64734)

![Data collector (profit/equity)](https://c.mql5.com/i/code/indicator.png)
[Data collector (profit/equity)](/en/code/65634)

I wrote this indicator to compare two modes, timeframes and analyze the settings of my EA. You can make adjustments to suit your requirements or add something. The data collected is saved to a file every 5 minutes (one file per instance).
