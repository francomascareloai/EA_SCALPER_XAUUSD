This multi-symbol indicator shows the price changes of symbols from the Market Watch between two dates defined by vertical lines.

This provides a convenient opportunity to evaluate what and how much has moved/moves to better/faster represent the market situation as a whole.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/161/5751228654596.png)

### Management.

The dates are supposed to be managed with the mouse. And display - through the keyboard by following keys.

```mql5
#define  KEYCODE_KEY_C          67 // |C| - KEY_C
#define  KEYCODE_NUMPAD_0       96 // |0| - NUMPAD_0
#define  KEYCODE_OPEN_BRACKET  219 // |[| - OPEN_BRACKET
#define  KEYCODE_CLOSE_BRACKET 221 // |]| - CLOSE_BRACKET
```

That allows you to quickly switch between the corresponding symbols. Convenience can be felt only by launching and trying it.

### Features.

The indicator restarts itself at startup. And self-starts when it changes the symbol.

Apparently the panic (first week of March 2025) doesn't really favour patterns. Looked at where the main movement is and where it is almost quiet.

A bit about the consequences of tramponomics.

Oil has reacted the strongest. If I were the carriers, I would stop buying fuel, because I don't understand the situation with the delivery of goods. Apparently, they think the same way, so the demand collapsed.

What will be the consequences of overfilling of warehouses/overproduction - it is unclear.

Well, the most entertaining thing is the flat on GBPHUF and GBPPLN.

It's hard to see why Hungary and Poland are tied so strongly to the UK during the panic.

This is a simple analytical (non-signal, one-time calculated) indicator that allows you to test the hypothesis that price timeseries represent a "random walk", specifically Gaussian "random walk". This can help to construct a parametric transformation of price increments into evenly distributed, more stable and predictable time series, at least in terms of volatility.
