Hi Mr. Mladen,

first thank you for all you've done, I learnt and use a lot of your comments and indicators.

I am using the MT4 Version of this awesome indicator, I would like to know is it possible to add this averages to indicator windows instead of chart? (like default MA) I want to [check](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/common/GetTickCount64 "MQL5 Documentation: GetTickCount64 function") slope change of indicator window.

Thank you so much.

There is a bug in the current version, so I changed line 165 as such ...

> ```mql5
>          if (bars<2 || times[0]>Time[0]) return(prev_calculated);
> ```

There may be other bugs but this one was the first I spotted due to the errors in the Experts log.
> ```mql5
> 2023.06.23 16:25:16.247 averages_-_mtf_2 (EURUSD,M1)    array out of range in 'averages_-_mtf_2.mq5' (165,20)
> 2023.06.23 16:30:00.355 averages_-_mtf_2 (EURUSD,M1)    array out of range in 'averages_-_mtf_2.mq5' (169,53)
> ```

I have attached the modified file.

That is a very, very old version and I do not use that way of multi time frame calculation for (almost as equally) very long time - those were the times when we were learning how to port stuff to MT5

In any case : thanks for updating that version

I did the update only because of this thread ... [https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/449505#comment\_47725572](/en/forum/449505#comment_47725572)

Thank you for that, but for some reasons this indicator only draws on the 1D time frame. Why is not visible on any other lower time frame?
