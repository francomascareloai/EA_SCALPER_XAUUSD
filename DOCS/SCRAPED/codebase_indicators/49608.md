This particular expert advisor contains a very useful code which is often required by the developers. Most of the time , we need the last active trade. But in this EA you can search a trade with any index.

By active trade ,I mean market orders not pending orders

if you pass 0 then it will fetch the most recent active trade

If you pass 1 then it will fetch the trade before that and so on.

We can filter  the trades based on symbol and magic number.

HarmonicEA is an Expert Advisor (EA) developed for MetaTrader 4 (MT4) that utilizes harmonic pattern recognition and RSI-based signals to identify potential trading opportunities in the forex market. The EA is designed to detect various bullish and bearish harmonic patterns, including crab, butterfly, bat, deep bat, AB=CD, 3-drive, 5-drive, and shark patterns, across multiple timeframes. It incorporates risk management features such as dynamic lot sizing based on a percentage of account balance, maximum drawdown control, and a trailing stop mechanism to protect profits. HarmonicEA is suitable for traders seeking an automated solution to capitalize on harmonic patterns while managing risk effectively.
