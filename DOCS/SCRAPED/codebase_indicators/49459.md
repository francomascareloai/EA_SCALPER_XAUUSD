Volume Oscillator is the ratio of two moving averages calculated on volume.

![](https://c.mql5.com/18/161/terminal64_GlzMg70v6p.png)

Calculation:

```mql5
LongEMA   = EMA(Volume, LongPeriod)

ShortEMA  = EMA(Volume, ShortPeriod)

VolumeOsc = 100 * (ShortEMA - LongEMA) / LongEMA
```

A rise or fall in price *along with an increase in volume* can potentially signal the strength of a trend. In this case, if the volume oscillator is above the zero line, it can be a confirmation of price direction and market trend, whether the market is in an uptrend or downtrend.

Divergences in the negative area of the oscillator can often signal that a trend reversal could potentially occur in the near future.  
  
 The indicator line fluctuates between above and below the zero line, which gives an indication of the price trend and whether the movement is strong or weak. Positive values of the oscillator suggest that there is sufficient market support for the price to continue its current trend direction. Negative values suggest that there is no market support, indicating that the price is stagnant or hinting at a trend reversal.

I decided to create this thread to help to myself and to the others to start with Metatrader 5.  
  
I am experienced in MT4 and in forex in general (i hope : ) but we traders really need to collect all the information about it in one place.  
I will make some posts about 'how I am starting with MT5'. :)

Please make your any question about Metatrader 5 and I will try to answer them,   
or we will reply all together.
