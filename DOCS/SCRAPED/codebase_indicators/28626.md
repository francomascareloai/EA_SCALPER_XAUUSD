**Power of XXX indicator description.**

The indicator is showing relative actual strength of currency XXX.

The indicator calculates its value of close prices of 7 pairs containing currency XXX.

The indicator can be used for MEAN REVERSION based strategies.

Lets assume XXX YYY currency pair scheme where XXX is BASE currency and YYY is QUOTEcurrency.

Place Power of XXX into your chart first and Power of YYY second.

You can have 2 relevant situations.

1. Indicators curves are close to each other. It means there is higher probability that the price of the pair XXX YYY will go **UP**.

   Do not take Power of .. signals separately from overall market situation (SR levels/zones and so on).

![UP](https://c.mql5.com/18/90/BASE_vs_QUOTE_currency_Power_of_UP__6.png "UP")

2. Indicators curves are FAR from each other. It means there is higher probability that the price of the pair XXX YYY will go **DOWN**.

   Do not take Power of .. signals separately from overall market situation (SR levels/zones and so on).

![DOWN](https://c.mql5.com/18/90/BASE_vs_QUOTE_currency_Power_of_DOWN__6.png "DOWN")

What does RED colour mean? If it is weak strength, how come you are selling two weak currencies?

Please tell how to find the strength of USD in H1 or H4 or D1 timeframe using your indicator.

Hi,

How to set the second window of this indicator i.e Power of CAD as in your picture above? I could not find optional to change USD to CAD .It is only fixed USD in indicator [parameter](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/directx/dxinputset "MQL5 Documentation: DXInputSet function").

Thanks.

Regards,

Henry

Hi Henry,

there are sepearate indicators for separate currencies.

Look at the name of the indicator.

One is for **USD** (Power of **USD** ...) , second is for **CAD** (Power of **CAD**...) , third is for **EUR**  (Power of **EUR**...) and so on.

Regards.
