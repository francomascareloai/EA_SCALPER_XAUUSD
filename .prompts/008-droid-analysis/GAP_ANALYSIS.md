## GAP 1: SECURITY-COMPLIANCE Droid

### 🔐 Why Critical

Trading systems handle **real money** and must comply with strict **prop firm rules**. Security failures have catastrophic consequences:

| Risk | Consequence | Likelihood |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Credential leak | API keys exposed → unauthorized trading | MEDIUM |
| Compliance violation | Apex rule breach → account termination | HIGH |
| Data exposure | User/trade data leaked | LOW |
| Unauthorized access | Malicious trade execution | LOW |

### Current State (GAP)

- **No dedicated security scanning** - Code reviewed ad-hoc
- **No credential management validation** - .env usage not verified
- **Compliance checks scattered** - In SENTINEL but not systematic
- **No audit trail** - Sensitive operations not logged

### Proposed Droid

```yaml
name: security-compliance-guardian
version: 1.0
priority: CRITICAL

responsibilities:
  security_audit:
    - Scan code for hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
    - Verify .env usage (no secrets in code/logs)
    - Check for insecure patterns (SQL injection, XSS in logs)
    - Validate input sanitization
    
  credential_management:
    - Audit .env.example completeness
    - Verify no secrets in git history
    - Check API key rotation policies
    - Validate broker API security
    
  compliance_validation:
    - Verify Apex rules enforced in code
    - Trailing DD calculation correctness
    - Time constraint enforcement (4:59 PM ET)
    - 30% consistency rule compliance
    
  access_control:
    - Document who can modify risk parameters
    - Review deployment permissions
    - Validate trade execution authorization
    
  audit_trail:
    - Log all sensitive operations
    - Track configuration changes
    - Record risk parameter modifications

commands:
  /security-scan [file|module]: Scan for security vulnerabilities
  /compliance-audit: Full Apex compliance verification
  /secrets-check: Search for exposed credentials
  /audit-log: Review sensitive operation history

integration:
  invoke_before: Any deployment
  invoke_after: Risk parameter changes
  handoff_to: FORGE (for fixes), SENTINEL (for risk assessment)
```

### Justification Matrix

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **What problem does it solve?** | Prevents credential leaks, ensures prop firm compliance |
| **Risk if missing?** | Account termination, unauthorized trades, data breach |
| **Workaround exists?** | Manual security audits (not scalable, error-prone) |
| **Implementation effort** | MEDIUM (2-3 days) |
| **ROI** | HIGH (prevents catastrophic failure) |

### Recommendation

**CREATE IMMEDIATELY (Phase 1)**

```

### Justification Matrix

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **What problem does it solve?** | Ensures data quality for reliable backtests |
| **Risk if missing?** | Bad data → biased backtests → poor live performance |
| **Workaround exists?** | Manual data management (error-prone) |
| **Implementation effort** | COMPLEX (3-4 days) |
| **ROI** | MEDIUM (quality data = quality decisions) |

### Recommendation

**CREATE LATER (Phase 2)**

## GAP 4: MONITORING-ALERTING Droid

### 📡 Why Critical

Real-time monitoring prevents account blows and catches issues early:

| What to Monitor | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| Trailing DD | Approaching 10% = emergency |
| Equity curve | Anomalous drops = problem |
| Position status | Stuck positions = risk |
| Execution quality | Slippage trends = concern |

### Current State (GAP)

- **Trailing DD checked only on trade** - Not real-time
- **No equity curve monitoring** - Anomalies undetected
- **No position alerts** - Stuck positions unknown
- **No dashboard** - Status requires manual queries

### Proposed Droid

```yaml
name: monitoring-alerting-operator
version: 1.0
priority: MEDIUM

responsibilities:
  real_time_monitoring:
    - Trailing DD (from HIGH-WATER MARK)
    - Current equity vs starting
    - Open position status
    - Time to market close (4:59 PM ET)
    
  alerting:
    - DD >8%: Slack/email alert
    - Equity drop >5% in 5min: Urgent alert
    - Stuck position >4h: Warning
    - <30min to close with positions: Critical
    
  anomaly_detection:
    - Unusual drawdown patterns
    - Execution delay spikes
    - Abnormal trade frequency
    - Strategy behavior changes
    
  dashboard:
    - Real-time DD gauge
    - Equity curve chart
    - Win rate rolling
    - Sharpe trailing
    
  circuit_breaker_integration:
    - Trigger SENTINEL emergency protocols
    - Auto-reduce risk on alerts
    - Force position closure if needed

commands:
  /status: Real-time account status
  /alerts: View recent alerts
  /dashboard: Open monitoring dashboard
  /anomaly [period]: Check for anomalies

alert_levels:
  INFO: Routine notifications
  WARNING: Needs attention (DD >6%)
  CRITICAL: Immediate action (DD >8%)
  EMERGENCY: Account at risk (DD >9.5%)

integration:
  always_running: True (background monitoring)
  handoff_to: SENTINEL (for emergency protocols)
```

### Justification Matrix

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **What problem does it solve?** | Early warning system for account risk |
| **Risk if missing?** | Account blow without warning |
| **Workaround exists?** | Manual monitoring (impossible 24/7) |
| **Implementation effort** | MEDIUM (2-3 days) |
| **ROI** | MEDIUM (safety net) |

### Recommendation

**CREATE LATER (Phase 2)**

## GAP 5: DEPLOYMENT-DEVOPS Droid

### 🚀 Why Critical (Lower Priority)

Professional deployment practices prevent errors and enable rollback:

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Manual deployment | Human errors, inconsistency |
| No rollback | Stuck with broken version |
| Config drift | Dev/staging/prod differences |
| No health checks | Silent failures |

### Current State (GAP)

- **Manual deployment** - Copy files, restart services
- **No CI/CD pipeline** - Tests run ad-hoc
- **No environment management** - Config differences between environments
- **No automated rollback** - Recovery is manual

### Proposed Droid

```yaml
name: deployment-devops-engineer
version: 1.0
priority: LOW

responsibilities:
  ci_cd_pipeline:
    - Automated test execution
    - Build validation
    - Deployment automation
    - Integration testing
    
  environment_management:
    - Dev/staging/prod config management
    - Secrets management (vault integration)
    - Environment parity verification
    - Config version control
    
  deployment:
    - Blue-green deployment support
    - Canary releases (paper → live)
    - Zero-downtime updates
    - Database migration handling
    
  rollback:
    - Automated rollback on failure
    - Version tagging
    - State preservation
    - Quick recovery procedures
    
  health_checks:
    - Post-deployment validation
    - Smoke tests
    - Integration verification
    - Alert on deployment failure

commands:
  /deploy [env]: Deploy to environment
  /rollback [version]: Rollback to version
  /status [env]: Check environment status
  /config-diff [env1] [env2]: Compare configs
  /health-check [env]: Run health checks

environments:
  dev: Local development
  staging: Paper trading / simulation
  prod: Live trading

integration:
  invoke_after: All tests pass
  requires: ORACLE validation for prod deploy
  handoff_to: MONITORING (post-deploy)
```

### Justification Matrix

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **What problem does it solve?** | Professional deployment practices |
| **Risk if missing?** | Deployment errors, no rollback capability |
| **Workaround exists?** | Manual deployment (works but risky) |
| **Implementation effort** | COMPLEX (3-4 days) |
| **ROI** | LOW (maturity, not critical) |
