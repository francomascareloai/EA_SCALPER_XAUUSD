## Overlap Analysis

### Overlap 1: Code Architecture (FORGE vs NAUTILUS)

#### Current State

| Aspect | FORGE | NAUTILUS |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Python/Nautilus implementation | MQL5→Nautilus migration |
| **Handles** | Day-to-day coding, debugging | Architecture decisions |
| **Code Type** | Any Python trading code | NautilusTrader-specific |
| **Templates** | Anti-patterns, test scaffolds | Strategy/Actor/Backtest |

#### Overlap Zone

Both droids work with **NautilusTrader Python code**, causing confusion:

```
User: "I need to create a Strategy for gold scalping"

FORGE thinks: "I implement Python code with tests"
NAUTILUS thinks: "I design Strategy architecture and migration"

WHO TO INVOKE?
```

#### Resolution

```yaml
clear_boundaries:
  NAUTILUS:
    - High-level architecture decisions (Strategy vs Actor)
    - MQL5 → Nautilus migration mapping
    - Backtest setup (ParquetDataCatalog, BacktestNode)
    - Event-driven pattern guidance
    - Performance target definition
    
  FORGE:
    - Low-level implementation
    - Debugging (Deep Debug protocol)
    - Testing (pytest scaffolds)
    - Code quality (anti-patterns)
    - Context7 documentation queries

workflow:
  step_1: NAUTILUS designs architecture
  step_2: FORGE implements code
  step_3: NAUTILUS validates backtest setup
  step_4: FORGE fixes issues

routing_rule:
  "design Strategy" → NAUTILUS
  "implement Strategy" → FORGE
  "migrate from MQL5" → NAUTILUS
  "fix bug in Strategy" → FORGE
  "setup backtest" → NAUTILUS
```

#### Documentation Update

Add to AGENTS.md `<handoffs>`:

```xml
<handoff from="NAUTILUS" to="FORGE" trigger="implement">
  NAUTILUS designs architecture → FORGE implements
  Pass: Architecture spec, file locations, patterns to follow
</handoff>

<handoff from="FORGE" to="NAUTILUS" trigger="validate">
  FORGE implements → NAUTILUS validates backtest
  Pass: Code files, test results, backtest config
</handoff>
```

---

### Overlap 2: Code Review (FORGE vs code-architect-reviewer vs senior-code-reviewer)

#### Current State

| Droid | Focus | Depth |
|-------|-------|-------|
| FORGE | Python/Nautilus patterns | Day-to-day |
| code-architect-reviewer | Systemic review, consequences | Pre-commit |
| senior-code-reviewer | Generic best practices | N/A (archived?) |

**Note:** senior-code-reviewer doesn't exist in current inventory - may be outdated reference.

#### Overlap Zone

Both FORGE and code-architect-reviewer do code review:

- FORGE: `/review` command with 20-item checklist
- code-architect-reviewer: 5-layer review with consequence analysis

#### Resolution

```yaml
clear_boundaries:
  FORGE_review:
    - Day-to-day code quality
    - Python/Nautilus patterns
    - Anti-pattern detection
    - Quick 20-item checklist
    - Trigger: During development
    
  code-architect-reviewer:
    - Pre-commit comprehensive audit
    - Dependency mapping (upstream/downstream)
    - nth-order consequence analysis
    - Quality scoring (0-100)
    - Multi-solution ranking
    - Trigger: Before commit/deploy

workflow:
  during_development:
    - FORGE reviews incrementally
    - Catches immediate issues
    
  before_commit:
    - code-architect-reviewer runs full audit
    - Maps dependencies, consequences
    - Scores and approves/rejects

routing_rule:
  "review this code" → FORGE (during dev)
  "audit before commit" → code-architect-reviewer
  "pre-deploy review" → code-architect-reviewer
  "check my changes" → FORGE
```

---

### Overlap 3: Research (ARGUS vs research-analyst-pro vs deep-researcher)

#### Current State

| Droid | Focus | Size |
|-------|-------|------|
| argus-quant-researcher | Trading/quant research | 15KB |
| research-analyst-pro | Generic multi-source research | 31KB |
| deep-researcher | Deep research with critical thinking | 12KB |

**Total:** 58KB for essentially the same function

#### Overlap Zone

All three droids:
- Use multi-source triangulation
- Rate confidence levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Search academic + practical + empirical sources
- Produce research reports

#### Resolution

**MERGE INTO SINGLE DROID: ARGUS v3.0**

```yaml
merged_droid:
  name: argus-quant-researcher
  version: 3.0
  
  from_argus:
    - Trading-specific keywords and priority areas
    - RAG database queries (mql5-books, mql5-docs)
    - Automatic alerts for suspicious claims
    
  from_research_analyst_pro:
    - Quality assurance checklist (condensed)
    - Report structure template
    
  from_deep_researcher:
    - Scientific critical thinking checklist
    - Multi-layer research phases
    
  inherits_from_agents_md:
    - Generic workflow templates
    - Output format templates
    - Constraints/guardrails

routing_rule:
  ANY research request → ARGUS (single point)
```

#### Actions

1. Merge into argus-quant-researcher.md (15KB target)
2. Archive research-analyst-pro.md
3. Archive deep-researcher.md
4. Update all references

---

### Overlap 4: Backtest Validation (ORACLE vs CRUCIBLE)

#### Current State

| Droid | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| ORACLE | Statistical validity (WFA, Monte Carlo, DSR) |
| CRUCIBLE | Execution realism (slippage, spread, fills) |

#### Overlap Zone

Both validate backtests, but with different focus:

```
ORACLE asks: "Are these results statistically robust?"
CRUCIBLE asks: "Does this backtest model real execution?"
```

#### Resolution

**These are COMPLEMENTARY, not duplicative**

```yaml
clear_workflow:
  step_1:
    droid: CRUCIBLE
    action: "Validate execution realism"
    check: "25 Realism Gates ≥90%"
    
  step_2:
    droid: ORACLE
    action: "Validate statistical robustness"
    check: "WFE≥0.6, DSR>0, PSR≥0.85"
    
  decision:
    both_pass: "GO for live"
    one_fails: "NO-GO, address issues"

handoff:
  CRUCIBLE → ORACLE:
    trigger: "Realism validated, check statistics"
    pass: Backtest config, realism score
    
  ORACLE → CRUCIBLE:
    trigger: "Stats look suspicious, verify realism"
    pass: Statistical concerns to investigate
```

#### Documentation Update

Add to AGENTS.md:

```xml
<complementary_roles>
  <pair>
    <droid_a>CRUCIBLE</droid_a>
    <droid_b>ORACLE</droid_b>
    <relationship>Complementary validators</relationship>
    <workflow>CRUCIBLE validates realism → ORACLE validates statistics</workflow>
    <both_required>Yes - both must PASS for GO decision</both_required>
  </pair>
</complementary_roles>
```

## Conflict Scenarios & Resolutions

### Scenario 1: CRUCIBLE GO vs SENTINEL BLOCK

```yaml
situation:
  CRUCIBLE: "Excellent setup! Confluence 9/10, Tier A. GO."
  SENTINEL: "Trailing DD at 8.9%. BLOCK - too close to limit."

resolution:
  step_1: Domain is RISK (DD concern)
  step_2: SENTINEL has priority 1 authority for risk
  step_3: SENTINEL veto WINS
  
  outcome: "Trade blocked despite excellent setup"
  rationale: "Account survival > great setup"
```

### Scenario 2: ORACLE NO-GO vs CRUCIBLE LOOKS GOOD

```yaml
situation:
  CRUCIBLE: "Setup looks great in backtest, 2.5 profit factor"
  ORACLE: "NO-GO. WFE 0.42 - below threshold. Overfitting suspected."

resolution:
  step_1: Domain is VALIDATION (statistical concern)
  step_2: ORACLE has priority 2 authority for validation
  step_3: ORACLE NO-GO WINS
  
  outcome: "Strategy rejected despite good-looking metrics"
  rationale: "Statistical validity > surface-level performance"
```

### Scenario 3: NAUTILUS Actor vs FORGE Inline

```yaml
situation:
  NAUTILUS: "Use Actor pattern for divergence detection - decoupled, reusable"
  FORGE: "Inline in Strategy for 2ms performance gain"

resolution:
  step_1: Domain is ARCHITECTURE (pattern decision)
  step_2: NAUTILUS has priority 5 authority for architecture
  step_3: NAUTILUS suggestion WINS
  
  outcome: "Actor pattern used"
  rationale: "Long-term maintainability > 2ms gain"
  
  exception:
    if: "Performance budget critically tight (<5ms slack)"
    then: "FORGE concern elevated, discuss tradeoff"
```

### Scenario 4: FORGE Bug Fix vs ORACLE Re-validation

```yaml
situation:
  FORGE: "Fixed the bug, ready to deploy"
  ORACLE: "Code changed. Previous validation INVALID. Re-run WFA."

resolution:
  step_1: Domain is VALIDATION (code change impact)
  step_2: ORACLE has authority on validation requirements
  step_3: ORACLE wins - re-validation REQUIRED
  
  outcome: "Deployment blocked until WFA re-run"
  rationale: "Bug fix could affect strategy behavior"
```

### Scenario 5: CRUCIBLE Realism vs ORACLE Statistics

```yaml
situation:
  CRUCIBLE: "Realism Score 92%, backtest is realistic"
  ORACLE: "Sharpe 4.2 is suspicious. Check for overfitting."

resolution:
  step_1: Both have valid concerns (realism vs statistics)
  step_2: Complementary validators - both must pass
  step_3: ORACLE concern wins - investigate overfitting
  
  outcome: "Further investigation required"
  workflow: "Even realistic backtest can be overfit"
```

### Scenario 6: ARGUS Research vs FORGE Implementation

```yaml
situation:
  ARGUS: "Research shows Shannon entropy effective for regime detection"
  FORGE: "But implementation would exceed OnTick budget by 10ms"

resolution:
  step_1: Domain crosses RESEARCH and IMPLEMENTATION
  step_2: FORGE has implementation authority
  step_3: Negotiate: Can ARGUS find faster approach?
  
  outcome: "Research finding adapted to implementation constraint"
  workflow: "ARGUS → find alternative OR FORGE → optimize implementation"
```

### Scenario 7: ORCHESTRATOR Routing Conflict

```yaml
situation:
  User: "I need help with my Strategy"
  ORCHESTRATOR: Routes to NAUTILUS (architecture)
  User intent: Actually wanted FORGE (debug issue)

resolution:
  step_1: ORCHESTRATOR should clarify ambiguous requests
  step_2: Ask: "Do you need architecture guidance or debugging help?"
  step_3: Route based on clarification
  
  prevention: "ORCHESTRATOR always clarifies before routing ambiguous requests"
```
