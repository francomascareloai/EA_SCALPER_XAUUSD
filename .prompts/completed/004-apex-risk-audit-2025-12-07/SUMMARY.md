# Apex Risk Audit - Summary

## One-Liner
**⛔ NO-GO**: Time constraints (4:59 PM ET) missing, consistency rule (30%) missing, circuit breaker not integrated - 5 critical blockers for live Apex trading.

## Version
v1 - Initial audit (2025-12-07)

## Key Findings
• **Time constraints COMPLETELY MISSING** - Zero enforcement of 4:59 PM ET deadline (Apex violation → account termination)
• **Consistency rule COMPLETELY MISSING** - No tracking/enforcement of 30% daily profit limit (Apex violation → account termination)
• **Circuit breaker orphaned** - Complete 6-level implementation exists but NOT integrated in strategy
• **Trailing DD implemented but weak termination** - HWM tracking ✅, 10% limit ✅, but doesn't TERMINATE account on breach
• **FTMO remnants** - 6 references to "FTMO limits" in comments, zero "Apex" configuration
• **Compliance score: 3/10** - Strong foundations (HWM tracking, position sizing) but critical Apex-specific rules missing

## Decisions Needed
- **Approve 4.25-day effort** to fix P0 blockers (time constraints, consistency rule, circuit breaker integration, verification, termination)
- **Prioritize P0 work** before any live Apex deployment

## Blockers
1. **Time constraints missing** (2 days) - 4:59 PM ET deadline not enforced → Apex will terminate account if position held past deadline
2. **Consistency rule missing** (1 day) - 30% daily profit limit not tracked → Apex will terminate if exceeded
3. **Circuit breaker not integrated** (0.5 day) - No graduated protection → Higher DD breach risk
4. **Unrealized P&L unclear** (0.5 day) - Must verify it's included in DD calculation
5. **Weak termination** (0.25 day) - Breach blocks trades but doesn't STOP strategy

## Next Step
**Implement time constraint manager** (P0, highest priority, 2 days):
1. Create `TimeConstraintManager` class with ET timezone handling
2. Add 4-level warnings (4:00 PM, 4:30 PM, 4:55 PM, 4:59 PM ET)
3. Implement forced position closure at deadline
4. Integrate into strategy for continuous checks
5. Comprehensive testing (timezone, DST, edge cases)

Then: Consistency rule → Circuit breaker integration → Verification → Termination fix.

**DO NOT deploy to live Apex until all P0 blockers are resolved.**
