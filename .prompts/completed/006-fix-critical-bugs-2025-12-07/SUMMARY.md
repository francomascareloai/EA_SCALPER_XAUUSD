# Critical Bugs Fix - Summary (Phase 2)

## One-Liner
Phase 2 (backtest realism) P0 blockers cleared; status now **CONDITIONAL** pending P1 integrations/tests.

## Version
v3 - 2025-12-07

## Key Achievements
- Risk engine enabled; slippage applied; commissions netted in summaries.
- Execution threshold unified at 70 across strategy and runners.
- Position sizing now uses pip-based SL with spread/news multipliers.
- Apex ops: 4:59 PM ET flatten + no-overnight; daily reset hook in place.

## Decisions Needed
- Prioritize P1: circuit breaker/selector/entry optimizer wiring, YAML realism knobs, latency/partial fills, telemetry & E2E tests.

## Blockers
- None at P0; P1 items gate GO decision.

## Next Step
Implement P1 integrations and run E2E tests to advance from CONDITIONAL to GO.
