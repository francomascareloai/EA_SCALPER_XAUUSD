## Quality Assurance

### Preserved ✅
- All 7 mandatory reflection questions
- All 7 proactive scan categories
- All 6 intelligence amplifiers with decision tree
- All 4 complexity levels (SIMPLE/MEDIUM/COMPLEX/CRITICAL)
- All 7 agent definitions with triggers and MCPs
- All 11 handoff relationships
- Decision hierarchy (SENTINEL > ORACLE > CRUCIBLE)
- All Apex Trading constraints (trailing DD, overnight, consistency)
- Performance limits (OnTick <50ms, ONNX <5ms)
- All error recovery protocols (3-strike rule, circuit breaker)
- Platform support (Nautilus primary, MQL5 secondary)
- MQL5 compilation paths and commands
- Windows CLI guidance (PowerShell requirements)
- Document hygiene rules
- Git workflow
- New agent template checklist

### Removed ❌
- 4 verbose CDATA genius_mode_templates (checklist structure retained)
- 4 verbose amplifier usage examples (1 concise example retained)
- Verbose thinking_observability audit trail example (~100 lines)
- Redundant thinking_conflicts resolution examples
- Pattern_learning verbose workflow example
- Compressed_protocols verbose fast_mode example
- Repeated explanations of "7 questions" across sections
- Repeated Apex constraint mentions (now reference critical_context)
- Duplicate pattern definitions (merged into single section)
- Verbose feedback_loop calibration examples

### Modified ⚠️
- **genius_mode_templates**: Converted from 4 CDATA templates to inline checklists at complexity levels
- **pattern system**: Merged pattern_recognition_library + pattern_learning into single `pattern_recognition` section
- **amplifiers**: Merged intelligence_amplifiers + amplifier_protocols into single section with decision tree
- **observability**: Removed verbose audit trail template, kept format description only

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All agent identities preserved (7 agents with emoji, name, use_for, triggers, mcps)
- [x] All routing rules intact (platform routing, agent routing, handoffs)
- [x] All Apex constraints documented (trailing DD, overnight, consistency, risk_per_trade)
- [x] All mandatory protocols present (7 questions, proactive scans, complexity levels)
- [x] Platform support complete (Nautilus primary, MQL5 secondary, routing rules)
- [x] Error recovery mechanisms functional (3-strike, circuit breaker, emergency mode)
- [x] Version updated correctly (3.4.1 → 3.5.0)
- [x] Changelog accurate (documents optimization)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Implicit guidance in removed examples**
   - Risk: Some edge case handling was demonstrated in verbose examples
   - Mitigation: Retained 1 representative example per major concept; checklists capture essentials
   - Severity: LOW (amplifier decision tree provides clear guidance)

2. **Template format changes**
   - Risk: Users familiar with CDATA templates may need adjustment
   - Mitigation: Essential checklist items preserved in complexity levels
   - Severity: LOW (functionality equivalent)

3. **Reduced thinking_observability detail**
   - Risk: Audit trail format less explicit
   - Mitigation: Format description retained; agents can follow pattern
   - Severity: LOW (format description sufficient)

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Routing verification**: Invoke each agent with their triggers and verify correct routing
2. **Decision hierarchy test**: Simulate CRUCIBLE-SENTINEL-ORACLE conflicts to verify veto chain
3. **Complexity assessment**: Test auto-escalation triggers with multi-module changes
4. **Error recovery**: Trigger each 3-strike protocol to verify escalation works
5. **Apex compliance**: Verify all trading decisions reference critical_context constraints

## Summary

The optimization achieved a **69% character reduction** (114KB → 35KB) and **78% line reduction** (2,607 → 585) while preserving 100% of critical functionality. The aggressive reduction was possible because:

1. The original had **massive redundancy** - concepts repeated 3-5 times
2. **Verbose examples** could be compressed to essential checklists
3. **CDATA templates** added 500+ lines with limited added value
4. **Pattern/amplifier systems** were duplicated across sections

The optimized version maintains the same agent routing, decision authority, safety protocols, and thinking frameworks - just without the repetition and verbosity.
