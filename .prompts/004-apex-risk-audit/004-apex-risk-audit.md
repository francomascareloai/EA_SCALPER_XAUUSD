# PROMPT 004: Apex Trading Risk Management Audit

## Objective

**Complete audit** of Apex Trading risk management implementation to ensure compliance with Apex rules (NOT FTMO):
- Validate trailing drawdown (10% from HWM, not fixed)
- Verify time-based position closure (4:59 PM ET deadline)
- Check consistency rule (max 30% profit in one day)
- Validate position sizing for Apex constraints
- Identify gaps, misconfigurations, and FTMO remnants

**Why it matters**: Apex rules are STRICTER than FTMO (trailing DD follows equity highs). User mentioned "gestão de risco não está adequada" and plan changed from FTMO to Apex. Need to verify COMPLETE migration of risk logic.

---

## Context

**Dependencies**:
- @.prompts/001-nautilus-plan-refine/nautilus-plan-audit.md (module status)
- @.prompts/003-backtest-code-audit/backtest-code-audit.md (risk module integration)

**Target files**:
- `nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/prop_firm_manager.py`
- `nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/position_sizer.py`
- `nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/drawdown_tracker.py`
- `nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/circuit_breaker.py`
- `nautilus_gold_scalper/src/strategies/gold_scalper_strategy.py` (risk integration)

**Known issues**:
1. Plan says "Apex Prop Firm" but risk modules may still have FTMO logic
2. Trailing DD is CRITICAL difference: Apex tracks HWM, FTMO doesn't
3. Time constraints (4:59 PM ET) may not be enforced
4. Consistency rule (30%) may not be checked

**Dynamic context**:
- !`grep -rn "FTMO\|ftmo" nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/` (FTMO remnants)
- !`grep -rn "Apex\|apex\|APEX" nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/` (Apex config)
- !`grep -rn "trailing.*dd\|HWM\|high.*water" nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/` (trailing DD)
- !`grep -rn "4:59\|cutoff\|ET\|time.*constraint" nautilus_gold_scalper/src/` (time checks)

## Requirements

### 1. Apex vs FTMO Rule Comparison

**Document differences**:

| Rule | FTMO | Apex | Implementation Status |
|------|------|------|----------------------|
| Daily DD | 5% fixed from start balance | N/A (only trailing) | ? |
| Overall DD | 10% fixed from start balance | 10% trailing from HWM | ? |
| HWM tracking | Not used | CRITICAL - tracks equity peak | ? |
| Unrealized P&L | Excluded from DD calc | INCLUDED in DD calc | ? |
| Time constraint | None | Must close by 4:59 PM ET | ? |
| Overnight | Allowed (with risk) | FORBIDDEN | ? |
| Consistency | None | Max 30% profit in one day | ? |
| Violation | Account reset | Account TERMINATED | ? |

**Validate**: Does codebase implement Apex column (NOT FTMO column)?

### 2. Trailing Drawdown Audit

**Critical logic**:
```python
# CORRECT (Apex):
HWM = max(HWM, current_equity)  # Track peak equity
current_DD = (HWM - current_equity) / HWM * 100
if current_DD > 10.0:
    TERMINATE_ACCOUNT()

# WRONG (FTMO):
current_DD = (start_balance - current_equity) / start_balance * 100
if current_DD > 10.0:
    RESET_ACCOUNT()
```

**Check in code**:
- Is HWM tracked correctly?
- Does HWM include unrealized P&L?
- Is DD calculated as `(HWM - current_equity) / HWM`?
- Is threshold exactly 10% (not 10.5% or buffer)?
- Is it checked on EVERY tick/trade update?

**Inspect**:
```bash
Read("nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/drawdown_tracker.py")
Read("nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/prop_firm_manager.py")
# Look for HWM tracking, DD formula, update frequency
```

### 3. Time Constraint Audit

**Apex rules**:
- 4:00 PM ET: Warning - prepare to close
- 4:30 PM ET: Urgent - start closing positions
- 4:55 PM ET: Emergency - close ALL positions
- 4:59 PM ET: DEADLINE - must be flat

**Check in code**:
- Are time checks present?
- Is timezone handled correctly (ET = America/New_York)?
- Are warnings/alerts triggered at each level?
- Is position closure FORCED at deadline?
- What happens if close fails (network issue)?

**Inspect**:
```bash
grep -rn "4:59\|cutoff\|deadline\|ET.*time\|America/New_York" nautilus_gold_scalper/
# Look for time checks, timezone handling, forced closure
```

### 4. Consistency Rule Audit

**Apex rule**: Max 30% of total profit in a single day

**Example**:
- Account at $50k, made $500 total profit over 10 days
- Day 11: If profit > $150 (30% of $500), stop trading for the day

**Check in code**:
- Is total profit tracked?
- Is daily profit tracked?
- Is 30% limit enforced?
- Does it stop new trades or close existing?

**Inspect**:
```bash
grep -rn "consistency\|30.*percent\|profit.*limit\|daily.*profit" nautilus_gold_scalper/
```

### 5. Position Sizing Audit

**Apex considerations**:
- Max risk/trade: 0.5-1% (conservative near HWM)
- Must account for trailing DD buffer (e.g., 8% buffer = only 2% room)
- Kelly criterion may be too aggressive
- ATR-based sizing more stable

**Check in code**:
- Does position_sizer.py consider trailing DD?
- Is max risk/trade configurable and enforced?
- Is Kelly capped (e.g., max 0.25 Kelly)?
- Is sizing reduced when close to DD limit?

**Inspect**:
```bash
Read("nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/position_sizer.py")
# Look for DD-aware sizing, Kelly capping, dynamic adjustment
```

### 6. Circuit Breaker Validation

**6 levels documented** (from plan):
1. Level 1: First loss
2. Level 2: Two losses in row
3. Level 3: Three losses in row
4. Level 4: DD approaching threshold
5. Level 5: Win rate degradation
6. Level 6: Emergency halt

**Verify**:
- Are all 6 levels implemented?
- What triggers each level?
- What actions are taken (reduce size, skip trades, halt)?
- Are thresholds configurable?
- Is circuit breaker actually called in strategy?

**Inspect**:
```bash
Read("nautilus_gold_scalper/src/risk/circuit_breaker.py")
grep -rn "circuit.*breaker\|CircuitBreaker" nautilus_gold_scalper/src/strategies/
```

### 7. Integration Validation

**Check strategy integration**:
- Does `gold_scalper_strategy.py` import risk modules?
- Are risk checks performed BEFORE order submission?
- Are risk updates performed AFTER fills/cancels?
- Is HWM updated on every equity change?
- Are time checks performed continuously?

**Execution flow**:
```
on_bar/on_tick:
  ├─> Update equity
  ├─> Update HWM (if equity > HWM)
  ├─> Check trailing DD → HALT if violated
  ├─> Check time → CLOSE if past 4:59 PM
  ├─> Check consistency → SKIP if limit hit
  ├─> Calculate position size (DD-aware)
  ├─> Check circuit breaker → REDUCE or SKIP if triggered
  └─> Submit order (if all checks pass)
```

**Validate**: Is this flow present?

### 8. Configuration Audit

**Check config files**:
- `configs/risk_config.yaml` or similar
- Are Apex limits hardcoded or configurable?
- Are defaults SAFE (conservative)?

**Example safe config**:
```yaml
prop_firm: "apex"  # NOT "ftmo"
trailing_dd_limit: 10.0  # percent
dd_buffer: 2.0  # stop trading at 8% to avoid breach
time_cutoff: "16:59"  # 4:59 PM
consistency_limit: 30.0  # percent of total profit
max_risk_per_trade: 0.5  # percent of balance
```

### 9. Gap Identification

**Missing features**:
- Alerts/notifications when approaching limits?
- Logging of risk events (DD changes, time warnings)?
- Backtesting mode vs live mode (stricter in live)?
- Emergency contact (halt trading remotely)?
