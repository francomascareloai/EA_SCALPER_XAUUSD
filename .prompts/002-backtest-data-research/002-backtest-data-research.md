# PROMPT 002: Backtest Data Sources Research

## Objective

**Deep research** to evaluate and compare data sources for realistic XAUUSD backtesting:
- Current: Dukascopy tick data (as mentioned in plan)
- Alternatives: TrueFX, FXCM, Pepperstone, TickData.com, etc.
- Assess quality, completeness, cost, integration complexity
- Recommend best source(s) for Apex Trading compliance

**Why it matters**: Garbage data = garbage backtest. Need highest quality tick data to validate strategies before live trading. Apex Trading requires realistic slippage, spreads, and execution modeling.

---

## Context

**Current assumption**: Plan mentions "TIC da Dukascopy" as data source

**Dynamic context**:
- !`find data/ -name "*dukascopy*" -o -name "*tick*" 2>/dev/null | head -5` (current data files)
- !`grep -r "dukascopy\|tick.*data\|data.*source" nautilus_gold_scalper/ | head -10` (references in code)

**Requirements**:
- Tick-level data (not just M1 bars)
- Bid/Ask spreads (for realistic slippage)
- 5+ years history (for WFA)
- XAUUSD specific (gold vs USD)
- Volume data (if available)
- Minimal gaps/missing data

---

## Requirements

### 1. Multi-Source Comparison

**Evaluate at least 5 sources**:
1. **Dukascopy** (current assumption)
2. **TrueFX** (free tick data)
3. **TickData.com** (premium)
4. **FXCM** (via API)
5. **Pepperstone** (broker data)
6. **Others** (if relevant)

**Comparison matrix**:
| Source | Data Type | History | Cost | Quality Score | Gaps % | Integration |
|--------|-----------|---------|------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Dukascopy | Tick (bid/ask) | ? | Free | ? | ? | ? |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 2. Quality Assessment

**For each source, verify**:
- **Completeness**: Missing periods? Weekends? Holidays?
- **Accuracy**: Spread realism? Outlier filtering?
- **Resolution**: True ticks vs interpolated?
- **Latency**: Historical only or real-time too?
- **Format**: CSV, Parquet, API, FIX?

**Scoring rubric** (0-10):
- 10: Tick-level bid/ask, <0.1% gaps, proven by institutions
- 7-9: Tick-level, <1% gaps, widely used
- 4-6: M1 bars or >1% gaps
- 0-3: Unusable (large gaps, unrealistic spreads)

### 3. Apex Trading Specific

**Apex requirements**:
- Realistic spreads (XAUUSD: 15-50 cents typical)
- Slippage modeling (5-15 cents on average)
- No "perfect" fills (real-world friction)
- Gap handling (Sunday opens, news events)

**Validate**: Does the data source support Apex-realistic backtesting?

### 4. Integration Complexity

**Assess**:
- NautilusTrader compatibility? (Parquet catalog format)
- Download automation? (API vs manual)
- Storage requirements? (5 years of ticks = how many GB?)
- Preprocessing needed? (clean, resample, validate)

### 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Free vs Paid**:
- Is premium data worth the cost for this project?
- Can free sources (TrueFX, Dukascopy) meet quality bar?
- Monthly subscription vs one-time purchase?

### 6. Community Validation

**Research**:
- What do quant traders use for XAUUSD backtesting?
- Any academic papers citing specific sources?
- Nautilus documentation recommendations?
- Known issues/complaints about sources?

## Intelligence Rules

**Triangulation**: Use academic (papers) + industry (docs) + empirical (community) sources.

**Confidence levels**: Assign HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence to each claim based on verification.

**Parallelism**: Run multiple searches simultaneously:
```
perplexity("Dukascopy"), exa("TrueFX"), brave("TickData reviews"), ... in ONE message
```

**Depth**: This is deep research - don't just skim first page of Google results.

## Notes

- User mentioned "TIC da Dukascopy" but unsure if it's the best
- Apex Trading requires realistic execution modeling
- This research informs prompt 003 (backtest code audit)
- No dependencies on other prompts (can run in parallel with 001)
