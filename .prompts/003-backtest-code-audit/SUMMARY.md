# Backtest Code Audit - Summary

## One-Liner
P0s cleared (risk engine on, slippage applied, cutoff/overnight enforced, pips sizing, daily reset); remaining P1s keep status **CONDITIONAL** until integration/tests/telemetry land.

## Version
v3 - Post-fix update (2025-12-07)

## Key Findings
- Risk engine enforced; slippage injected; execution threshold aligned to 70; summary nets commissions.
- Apex ops: 4:59 PM ET flatten + no-overnight; PropFirmManager now resets daily; SpreadMonitor affects score/size.
- Remaining gaps: CircuitBreaker/StrategySelector/EntryOptimizer still unused; DrawdownTracker reset uses wall-clock; YAML realism knobs not loaded.
- No latency/partial-fill model; no Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/SQN outputs; no end-to-end backtest coverage yet.

## Decisions Needed
- Prioritize P1 integration (circuit breaker/selector/entry optimizer) and YAML-driven realism before GO decision.
- Approve adding latency/partial-fill model and telemetry metrics (Sharpe/Sortino/Calmar/SQN, DD%) in runners.

## Blockers
- None at P0; P1 items above gate GO decision.

## Next Step
Implement P1 items (integration + YAML + E2E test + latency/partial fills/metrics), then rerun tick backtest to move from CONDITIONAL to GO.
