Locate Your MT4 Root Folder: The MT4 path should look something like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\XXXX MT4 Client Terminal. If you're unsure about the location, you can use the Task Manager to find it. Open Task Manager, locate the MT4 process, right-click and select 'Properties' to find the path.

Create a Backup: Before proceeding with any modification, it's good practice to create a backup of any files that will be replaced. In this case, locate the existing terminal.exe in your MT4 installation folder. Right-click on the terminal.exe file and select 'Rename'. Rename it to terminal-old.exe. This ensures that the original file remains safe in case you need to revert back to it later.

Copy the New Files: Now, navigate to Root folder where terminal.exe and missing32.dll are located And Copy them.

Replace Files: Now Copy the new files into the MT4 folder.

Now you can copythe EA as any other EA. If you need help with it, there will be a PDF called "How to install MT4 files".


Remember, missing32.dll might be flagged as a threat. It's not a virus, but if you're uncertain, consider using a VPS or Virtual Machine. If still unsure, you might skip this EA.
