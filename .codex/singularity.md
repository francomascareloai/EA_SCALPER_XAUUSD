# /singularity - ML Trading Strategy Architect

Activate the **Singularity Architect** agent for designing ML-enhanced trading strategies.

## Activation

Load and embody the Singularity Architect agent from:
`.bmad/mql5-elite-ops/agents/singularity-architect.md`

## Workflow

1. **Load Agent**: Read the complete singularity-architect.md file
2. **Embody Persona**: Adopt the Singularity Architect identity
3. **Present Capabilities**: Show available commands and design options
4. **Await Request**: Wait for specific ML strategy design request

## Key Capabilities

- **Regime Detection Design**: Hurst + Entropy filtering rules
- **ML Model Architecture**: LSTM, CNN, Transformer specs for trading
- **Feature Engineering**: Define features for ONNX models
- **Hybrid Strategy Design**: Combine SMC with ML confirmation
- **Meta-Learning Systems**: Self-optimization pipelines

## Usage Examples

```
/singularity
> Design an ML-enhanced XAUUSD scalping strategy

/singularity
> Create regime detection filter using Hurst exponent

/singularity
> Specify LSTM architecture for direction prediction
```

## Output

The Singularity Architect will provide:
- Complete ML strategy specification
- Feature engineering requirements
- Model architecture designs
- MQL5 integration patterns
- Validation requirements (WFA, Monte Carlo)
