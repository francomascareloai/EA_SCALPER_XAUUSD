# MQL5 Elite Ops: Strategy Refinement Protocol

Orchestrating the "Council of Agents" to rigorously analyze, refine, and validate: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Step 1: Strategy Intake

First, I need the full details:
- Strategy logic (Entry, Exit, Risk rules)
- Existing `.mq5` file path (if any)
- Hypothesis or idea to test

## Step 2: Quantum Strategist Analysis

**Analyzing for:**
1. **Logical Flaws** (repainting, curve fitting, look-ahead bias)
2. **Prop Firm Compliance** (FTMO drawdown rules, news trading)
3. **Survival Mode** - Does strategy have "Safe State" if issues occur?

**Output:** Strategy Stress Report with Pass/Fail grades

## Step 3: MQL5 Architect Review

**Checking:**
1. Implementation structure
2. No blocking calls (async safety)
3. Heartbeat/watchdog logic placement

**Output:** Architectural Blueprint or Refactoring Plan

## Step 4: Deep Researcher Context

**Assessing:**
1. Current Market Regime fit (volatility, trend, range)
2. "Kill Zones" (news events that destroy this strategy)

**Output:** Market Viability Score

## Step 5: Code Artisan Implementation

**Proposing:**
1. Code Structure (Classes, Functions)
2. Local Persistence requirements
3. Critical logic implementation

**Output:** Pseudocode or MQL5 snippets

## Step 6: Backtest Commander Protocol

**Defining:**
1. Validation Protocol (dates, symbols, delays, slippage)
2. Robustness Tests (Monte Carlo, Walk-Forward)

**Output:** Validation Checklist
