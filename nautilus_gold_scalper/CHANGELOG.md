### 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE

**What:** Fixed 7 CRITICAL GAPS in AGENTS.md for $50k account protection + added critical_bug_protocol  
**Why:** Franco identified system managing $50k needs maximum quality - gaps could cause account termination  
**Impact:** AGENTS.md v3.6.0 now has BLOCKING enforcement for all critical workflows:
- ✅ GAP #1: Emergency DD >4.5% (was >9% - inconsistent with Apex 5%)
- ✅ GAP #2: Pre-trade Apex checklist MANDATORY (6 checks BLOCK if fail)
- ✅ GAP #3: Trading logic 4-agent review ENFORCED (FORGE→REVIEWER→ORACLE→SENTINEL chain required)
- ✅ GAP #4: Sequential-thinking BLOCKING for CRITICAL tasks (15+ thoughts required, not optional)
- ✅ GAP #5: Production error protocol (immediate halt, 5 Whys, prevention updates)
- ✅ GAP #6: Pre-deploy profiling+coverage MANDATORY (OnTick <50ms, risk/ 90%+ coverage)
- ✅ GAP #7: Handoff gates BLOCKING (can't skip REVIEWER, ORACLE, SENTINEL validation)

**Prevention:** Added `<critical_bug_protocol>` with MANDATORY 5 Whys + Prevention steps for all CRITICAL bugs (Apex violations, $50k risks). Includes production_error_protocol with immediate halt procedures.

**Files:**
- AGENTS.md (v3.6.0 - 7 gaps fixed, critical_bug_protocol added)
- nautilus_gold_scalper/BUGFIX_LOG.md (restructured with CRITICAL template)
- MQL5/Experts/BUGFIX_LOG.md (restructured with CRITICAL template)
- nautilus_gold_scalper/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md (added SOURCE fields to P1 ideas)

**Validation:** All AGENTS.md sections updated with BLOCKING enforcement, examples added for CRITICAL bug prevention  
**Commit:** pending

### ✨ FEATURE

**What:** Created FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md brainstorming repository (TEMPLATE FIX - matched to DOCS/ format)  
**Why:** Franco requested "base de ideias" for optimizations + asked to fix template format to match DOCS/02_IMPLEMENTATION/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md structure  
**Impact:** Clean, organized repository with STATUS GERAL tables (JÁ IMPLEMENTADO vs NÃO IMPLEMENTADO), PHASEs by priority (P1-P4), consistent format per idea (Motivacao/Arquivos alvo/Proposta/Esforco/Dependencies/Referencias). 12 ideas ready: Fibonacci (P1), Kelly (P1), Bayesian (P2), HMM (P2), Transformer (P2), WFO (P3), Meta-learning (P4), etc.  
**Files:**
- nautilus_gold_scalper/FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md (recreated with correct template)
- AGENTS.md (updated future_improvements_tracking section)

**Validation:** Template now matches DOCS/ structure exactly - tables, phases, code examples, archive sections (IMPLEMENTED/REJECTED)  
**Commit:** pending

### ⚙️ CONFIG

**What:** Created CHANGELOG.md tracking system for COMPLETED work units + BUGFIX_LOG.md for discovered bugs  
**Why:** Franco requested systematic logging to prevent losing context, but ONLY when work complete (not individual edits)  
**Impact:** FORGE/NAUTILUS logs when work unit DONE (e.g., 10 edits = 1 log entry), bugs logged immediately when discovered  
**Files:**
- nautilus_gold_scalper/CHANGELOG.md (this file)
- nautilus_gold_scalper/BUGFIX_LOG.md (created)
- MQL5/Experts/CHANGELOG.md (created)
- MQL5/Experts/BUGFIX_LOG.md (created)
- AGENTS.md (updated code_change_tracking + git_workflow + forge_rule)

**Validation:** Documentation complete, enforcement rules added to AGENTS.md, philosophy: completion-based, NOT edit-based  
**Commit:** pending
