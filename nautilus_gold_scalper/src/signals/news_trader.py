News-based trading signal generation for XAUUSD.

Migrated from: MQL5/Include/EA_SCALPER/Strategy/CNewsTrader.mqh
              MQL5/Include/EA_SCALPER/Analysis/CNewsFilter.mqh

Three trading modes:
1. PRE_POSITION: Enter 5-10 minutes before news release with directional bias
2. PULLBACK: Wait for initial spike, enter on 38-50% retracement
3. STRADDLE: Place orders in both directions, cancel loser (OCO)

Critical news events for XAUUSD:
- NFP (Non-Farm Payrolls): Strong USD data = Gold down
- CPI (Inflation): High inflation = Gold up (but hawkish Fed = Gold down)
- FOMC (Fed Rate Decision): Hawkish = USD up = Gold down
- GDP: Strong growth = USD up = Gold down
- Jobless Claims: High unemployment = USD down = Gold up
